<p>DITEK's alarm system surge protectors protect your security system versus transient surges that can go into through AC power lines, telephone lines and remote notice zones.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, removing the requirement for more electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, typically through 110VAC power.</p>
<p>Recording the video from your security cameras requires hard disks or cloud based storage. If you have an analog security camera system, then the digital video recorder (DVR) that the security cameras are connected to has a hard drive within it.
