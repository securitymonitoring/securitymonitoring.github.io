The Wi-Fi Alliance just recently revealed its next-generation wireless network security standard which aims to fix a typical security problem: open Wi-Fi networks. More than that, it features security enhancements and includes a suite of functions to streamline Wi-fi security configuration for users and service providers.

This will scare off some trespassers, but frequently doesn't do much beyond that. These normally aren't part of a monitoring system either - they act by themselves. Sometimes you can get door or window sensors that have local" alarms that just sound throughout the home - but these tend to be very simple to deactivate.</p>
