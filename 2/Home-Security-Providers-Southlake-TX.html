Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to disregard items that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
