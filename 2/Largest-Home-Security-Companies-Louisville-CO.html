<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. When it identified any type of interference, SimpliSafe reacted with a statement stating the system would signal users. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a best storm of situations for somebody to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to reproduce the concern. Although our screening shouldn't be taken as definitive, we believe this problem is unlikely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe customers who own the current system.</p>

Lots of insurer provide discounts on insurance coverage premiums to clients with operable alarm systems. These discounts may be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of cops departments provide several "totally free" false alarms prior to imposing any fine, even though the cost to react is significant right from the start. The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance providers call into question the suitability of the present pattern in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or 4 free false alarms per calendar year, due to the fact that they provide no up-front rewards to encourage owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
