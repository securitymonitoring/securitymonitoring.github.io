<h3>Wireless Alarm System in Raymond NH</h3>

<h3>New Home Security Systems in New Hampshire</h3>
<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine people the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to recognize those people and will send mobile phone informs with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
