Among IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send information over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the footage from anywhere. A common misconception is that wireless means the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still require a power cord. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then connects to a router and the internet. Finally, wire-free cameras are completely cable television free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the simplest alternative to install and all of the recorded video is saved in the cloud.</p>
