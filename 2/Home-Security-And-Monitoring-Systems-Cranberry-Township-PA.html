<p>We provide value-added security and surveillance systems and services offering benefit, comfort and complete satisfaction to every client and are committed to fulfilling our consumer's requirements with integrity, honesty, enthusiasm and excellent service. Among IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send out information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and permits that user to see the footage from anywhere. A common mistaken belief is that wireless means the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still require a power cord. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then connects to the internet and a router. Finally, wire-free cameras are entirely cable free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the easiest alternative to install and all of the recorded video footage is stored in the cloud.</p>
