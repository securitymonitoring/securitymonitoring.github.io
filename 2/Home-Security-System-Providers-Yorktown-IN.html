	<meta name="description" content="Smart Home Security Monitoring in Yorktown Indiana - That means even if you don't pay the monthly fee, the system will still alert you through your smartphone if it detects a threat, but you are responsible for contacting emergency services such as the police or fire department—so your phone needs to stay on and you need to be willing to field alerts, even at 2:00 a.m. It's nice that the system has a monitoring option, though, in case you don't always want that responsibility, such as when you're on vacation.">

<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security specialists researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a great security camera and an extraordinary worth. It receives an Exceptional rating for video quality and is simpler to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership plans for extra cloud storage. However the company does offer a Complete Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is detected. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>

<p>Exterior - Even if your business does not keep anything of important outside, outside security cameras can often be just as valuable as cameras put inside. Outside security cameras can monitor the parking lot, capture license plate numbers, or grab a shot of a burglar's face if the indoor camera misses it. Exterior cameras can likewise provide workers leaving late at night with assurance. On the other hand, if you don't wish to trouble with this procedure yourself, you can use the Brinks Pro Install services. If you pay upfront or $10 per month, the installation fee for this extra service is $199.</p>
<p>Best Professional Installation Security Company - While some security systems use easy DIY installation, other companies use (and often need) professional installation. Expert installation is readily available for wireless and hardwired home security systems. Bear in mind that cameras with two-way audio usually work like walkie talkies. You press a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's happening on the other end. And while this is a quite standard function in indoor cameras, two-way audio is reasonably rare in outdoor security cameras.</p>
