<p>ADT is a household name, so we often try out their systems to guarantee they're still up-to-task. In our newest round of testing, we realized that ADT is the most popular provider for a factor.

That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty busy with cool clever home functions. We especially liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>

<p>Ring might not be the most innovative system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), but it sure has gotten rather the fanfare over the years. We have actually been testing Ring Alarm a fair bit lately, and we actually like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a packaged security kit that provides basic intrusion protection with super-low regular monthly monitoring charges.

<p>Most video doorbells (like the RemoBell S) utilize your existing doorbell circuitry (two low-voltage wires) and are fairly easy to install, however there are battery-powered designs available (like the Ring Video Doorbell 2) that install in minutes. Some work with other smart devices such as door locks and sirens and support IFTTT and Alexa voice commands. We have actually divided out the Nest Camera IQs individually in our best security cameras 2020 list due to the fact that the outdoor and indoor variants actually are distinct gadgets, and which one you require will depend upon where you're putting them.</p>
<p>If you hold down the panic or fire alarm buttons on the burglar alarms touchpad for 1 to 3 seconds, an alarm is transferred to the ADT monitoring center, and emergency services are dispatched immediately.

And if you wish to include more cameras - both bullet and dome varieties - you can add another 4 to the setup in overall.</p>
