<h3>Electronic Security Systems Canal Winchester OH 43110</h3>
<p>In spite of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can protect that plug and include another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension package, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 ends up being more expensive general per system than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof solution. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it since its battery-saving routines can disrupt efficiency.</p>
