<p>Home security must never be restricted by where you can position or power your cameras, inside or outdoors.

Alarm Grid's self monitoring strategies are less costly and allow access to the great functions provided by Total Connect,, or Telguard without being connected to the main station. Additionally, aside from Self Bronze, all of Alarm Grid's self monitoring plans permit remote access to the robust home automation options made available through a Z-Wave enabled security system. Whether you live in an area where main station service is not readily available or preferred, self monitoring (provided world wide via internet interactions) is a cost efficient option for keeping you linked and as much as date with your professional security system.</p>
