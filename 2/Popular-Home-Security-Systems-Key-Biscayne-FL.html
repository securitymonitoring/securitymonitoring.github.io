CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime avoidance strategy, which argues that opportunities to offend can be decreased by changing a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a wrongdoer being apprehended, increasing the effort to devote the criminal activity, decreasing rewards from criminal activity commission, and lowering justifications that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).
