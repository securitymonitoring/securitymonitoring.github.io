<p>I have this camera attached to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without difficulty. The IR lights during the night are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the rate and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
