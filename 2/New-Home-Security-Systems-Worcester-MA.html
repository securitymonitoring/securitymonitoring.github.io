<h3>In House Alarm System Worcester MA 01604</h3>
<p>A tight wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to ignore items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
