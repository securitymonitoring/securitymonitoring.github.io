<p>Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you mean to keep and the length of time you plan to keep documented video. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage space quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest footage as soon as you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not mindful, the system might overwrite archived video that you still need.</p>
