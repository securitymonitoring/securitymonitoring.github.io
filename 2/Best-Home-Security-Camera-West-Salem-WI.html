<p>A tight wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to disregard objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
