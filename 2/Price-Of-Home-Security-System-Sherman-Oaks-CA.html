<h3>Best Surveillance Camera in Sherman Oaks CA</h3>
<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. If recording video footage in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
