<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, however not compatible with IP cameras.

Numerous insurer provide discounts on insurance coverage premiums to consumers with operable alarm systems. These discounts may be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many police departments offer a number of "free" false alarms before imposing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to react is considerable right from the start. The deals of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers bring into question the appropriateness of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or 4 complimentary incorrect alarms per calendar year, since they provide no up-front rewards to encourage owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
