<h3>Alarm And Camera Security System in Long Beach NY</h3>
<p>Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you plan to save and for how long you plan to keep taped video. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to eat up storage area rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video footage as soon as you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not cautious, the system might overwrite archived video that you still need.</p>
