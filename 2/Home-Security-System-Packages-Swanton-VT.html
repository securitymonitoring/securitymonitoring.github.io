Buying burglar security systems and devices from eBay truly makes alarm companies flee from a sale. Many alarm companies would rather supply and install their own equipment rather than go through this trouble. For the most detailed protection of your property, you want something that consists of night vision and can tape at a good quality - and nearly all cameras now come with at least HD (1080p) resolution.
