Bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor options because their style allows for minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is much better to have a camera geared up with infrared detection as opposed to motion detection. This will offer more accurate and less regular notifies because oftentimes the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
