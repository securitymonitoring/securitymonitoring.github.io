After testing, we sent each of our top picks, along with the Wyze Camera v2, to Bill McKinley, head of info security at The New York Times (Wirecutter's moms and dad company), for hack testing.

And that cost leaps a lot when you add wise cameras to any Blue system. We like that you can select from indoor, outdoor, and doorbell cameras, however every clever camera Blue offers is $200.</p>
