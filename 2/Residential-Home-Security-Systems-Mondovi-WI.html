Wyze's just recently introduced Complete Motion Capture resolves this issue for $1.50 monthly per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately starts another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are simple to find under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, however we don't suggest that for home security because if it's taken, you do not have a backup.</p>
