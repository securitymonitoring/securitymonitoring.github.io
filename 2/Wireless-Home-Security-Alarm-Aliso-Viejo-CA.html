<h2>The Best Home Security System You Can Install Yourself Aliso Viejo</h2>
<p>In a recent New york city Times article about Chicago's 911 broadening digital video surveillance system, Albert Alschuler, a law professor at Northwestern University, makes the point that public camera systems do not violate any privacy concerns because they are set up in public places. They have actually been implemented for public safety and criminal activity prevention and are not for the exploitation of individuals. An individual with a camcorder, or the paparazzi, might have a more self-satisfying agenda and thanks to digital innovation and the Internet can violate personal privacy laws with far more devastating effects than video surveillance cameras, which are kept secured and in strict confidence.</p>
