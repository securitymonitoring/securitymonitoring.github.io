Commercial cameras, however, often are equipped with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness immediately to the scene. This function is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear correctly exposed and completely detail. If a camera can not record and provide a properly-exposed and sharp  image during the day and at night, it has actually restricted usefulness.</p>
