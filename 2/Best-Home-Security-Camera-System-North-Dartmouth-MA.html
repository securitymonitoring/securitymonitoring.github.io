<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically much safer, but after reading this post, it will sure make you feel practically vulnerable. Do It Yourself security systems are perfect for basically any living scenario, including rental houses and apartment or condos. A number of the different accessories, such as the contact and motion sensors, come with strong two-sided adhesive, so you won't need to drill into walls (and run the risk of losing your down payment).
