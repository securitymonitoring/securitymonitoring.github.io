<p>Double courses enable difference in between hardware failures and a real attack on the alarm. This helps remove incorrect alarms and unneeded responses.

<p>As an inducement to buy an alarm, a number of companies provide "totally free monitoring services" for the very first few months. Many insurance provider provide discount rates on insurance premiums to consumers with operable alarm. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many police departments use numerous "free" incorrect alarms prior to imposing any fine, although the cost to react is considerable right from the start. The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers call into question the suitability of the existing trend in U.S. policing of enabling three or four complimentary false alarms per calendar year, since they offer no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
