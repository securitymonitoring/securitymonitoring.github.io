<p>Despite having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug.

Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it because its battery-saving regimens can interrupt efficiency.</p>
