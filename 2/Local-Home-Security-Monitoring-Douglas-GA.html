<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a quick explanation of how thermal cameras work: All objects produce infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy discharged by an item is known as its heat signature. In general, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it discharges. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that is capable of finding tiny differences in temperature. The gadget collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and develops an electronic image based upon details about the temperature level differences. Since things are seldom exactly the same temperature as other items around them, a thermal camera can identify them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>
