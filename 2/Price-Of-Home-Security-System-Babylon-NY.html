<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you wish to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the agreement.  So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I was in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Truly irritating. Once again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their client service team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to discuss it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the swelling sum, since apparently they auto renew you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.  ADT is a problem, method too expensive, and not great.</p>
