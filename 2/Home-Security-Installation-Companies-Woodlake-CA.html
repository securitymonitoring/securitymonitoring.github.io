<p>All persons with alarm protecting a facility in the City of Fredericksburg need to have a valid alarm permit. The integration of digital video surveillance and access control belongs to the natural merging of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single user interface provides extra information that may never ever have been possible in the past, such as alert of an employee, by name and recognition number, getting in the structure. An image of that staff member exists on screen for confirmation (verifying it's not a taken ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, ensuring no tailgating occurs.</p>
