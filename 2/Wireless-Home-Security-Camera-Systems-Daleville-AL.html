<h3>Wireless Home Security Alarm System in Alabama</h3>
<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can determine people the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send out smartphone signals with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
