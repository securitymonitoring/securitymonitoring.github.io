<p>Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer depends upon a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you intend to keep and the length of time you plan to keep recorded video footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video is going to eat up storage area rapidly.
