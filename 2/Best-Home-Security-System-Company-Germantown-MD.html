<p>Indoor cameras are fantastic for keeping an eye on your kids and pets, however if you're worried about security, you don't wish to risk missing out on a second of the action.

Although it doesn't have the best operating temperature level range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the couple of cameras on our list that come with a truly weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cord rather thick, so you can't truly run it through a window opening.</p>
