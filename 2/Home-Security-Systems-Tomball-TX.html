It's not as sharp as our other choices, however it's better than a great deal of cameras that are four times the cost. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after practically 2 years of night, day and use images have actually always been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing out on motion, a problem we encountered when checking the Wyze Web cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a smart feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted.

When making a choice, they are the only company of the 4 discussed that utilizes a mix of wired and wireless innovation so keep that in mind.</p>
