<p>We love the convenience and versatility of wireless home security cameras. Among our favorites, the Arlo Pro 3, is 100% wire-free.

<p>The disadvantage? It's extremely easy to commit security mistakes that will leave your home vulnerable. The minute you eliminate of signal range or turn your phone to aircraft mode is the moment you have actually left your house open. If you aren't mindful, this gaping hole in your security can show to be a huge problem. With a monitored system, that would not be an issue. However, with an unmonitored system, it's up to you to get in touch with the cops or other emergency services if your home remains in risk. Still, the unmonitored system is much less costly and for that reason is still the better option for many who are only worried about cost.</p>
