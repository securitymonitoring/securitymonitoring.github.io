The usual reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, providing an opportunity for the harmful enemy to tape these codes and use numerous breaking tools to analyze security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system.

<p>As an inducement to buy an alarm, a number of companies use "complimentary monitoring services" for the first couple of months. Numerous insurer provide discount rates on insurance coverage premiums to customers with operable alarm systems. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many police departments use several "complimentary" false alarms before imposing any fine, although the cost to respond is considerable right from the start. The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers cast doubt on the suitability of the existing trend in U.S. policing of permitting 3 or 4 complimentary incorrect alarms per fiscal year, since they offer no up-front incentives to motivate owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
