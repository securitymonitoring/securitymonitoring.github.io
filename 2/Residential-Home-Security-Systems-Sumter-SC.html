<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 businesses, universities, and government facilities, and residential clients. A basic system will normally just include the control board, sensors, and an audible alarm. If you want any other features, you will either have to buy a more advanced bundle or add-on to your basic system, which, depending upon the brand name, could get costly.

With an optional recording strategy, you can record, shop and share crucial video footage with police and neighbors.</p>
<p>Best Professional Installation Security Company - While some security systems provide easy DIY installation, other companies offer (and often require) professional installation. Professional installation is offered for hardwired and wireless home security systems. Remember that cameras with two-way audio usually work like walkie talkies. You press a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's happening on the other end. And while this is a pretty basic function in indoor cameras, two-way audio is reasonably unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>
