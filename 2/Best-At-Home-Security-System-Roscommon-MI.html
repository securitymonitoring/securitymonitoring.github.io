<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a brief explanation of how thermal cameras work: All objects discharge infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy discharged by an item is known as its heat signature. In general, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it gives off. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensing unit that is capable of discovering tiny distinctions in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and develops an electronic image based on information about the temperature level distinctions. Because things are hardly ever exactly the same temperature as other objects around them, a thermal camera can discover them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>
