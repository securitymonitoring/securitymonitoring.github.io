Conditions such as outdoor or indoor place and the existence or absence of light will play a huge role in choosing which camera is best suited for the job at hand. Numerous other designs were disqualified due to efficiency issues. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, frequently buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of up to 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
<p>Efficient in running in both normal and badly lit environments, these cameras benefit from not requiring inbuilt infrared illuminators as they can capture clear video images in the dark thanks to their additional delicate imaging chips. For this reason, these cameras are perfect for outdoor surveillance applications in which IR cameras are unable to function efficiently. Not only does Ring (now owned by Amazon) make video doorbells, it makes security cameras too: here we're chosen the wireless, battery powered design, but there is a wired variation as well if you do not wish to worry about ever having to recharge the batteries.</p>
