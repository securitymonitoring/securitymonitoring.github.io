<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a brief description of how thermal cameras work: All objects emit infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy released by an object is referred to as its heat signature. In general, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it releases. A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of identifying tiny differences in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from things in the scene and develops an electronic image based on info about the temperature distinctions.
