Among IP security alternatives, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A common misunderstanding is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still need a power cable. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then connects to a router and the web. Lastly, wire-free cameras are entirely cable television free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the simplest option to install and all of the recorded video is saved in the cloud.</p>
