Wyze's just recently introduced Total Motion Capture fixes this problem for $1.50 monthly per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, without any spaces in between. Recordings are simple to find under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the restricted cloud recording and microSD recording, however we do not suggest that for home security because if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>
