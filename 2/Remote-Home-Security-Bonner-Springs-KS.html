<p>But monitored systems likewise tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month fee for a set quantity of time, typically one to five years. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than devoting to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more common. These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that use a discount in exchange for that prolonged service agreement.

And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds costly, however it's not a lot when you think about that a live human being is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras identify suspicious activity. That individual at Deep Guard's center can alert a suspicious individual that they're being observed, and they can call your local cops dispatcher if they decline to engage or leave in a criminal act. It's not for everybody, but it's the best Do It Yourself outdoor security camera we've seen to date.</p>
