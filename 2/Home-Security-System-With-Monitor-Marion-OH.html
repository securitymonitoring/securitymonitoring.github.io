<p>Arlo claims that you should be able to get four to 6 months out of a fully charged battery, depending upon settings, use, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term screening of the camera, we generally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're worried about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that varied between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting screening, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>
