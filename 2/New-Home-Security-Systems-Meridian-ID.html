<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends possible culprits are less likely to dedicate criminal activity if they believe they are being viewed or have a higher risk of being collared. This is also known as the logical option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime prevention strategy, which argues that opportunities to offend can be reduced by changing a range of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a wrongdoer being apprehended, increasing the effort to commit the criminal activity, decreasing benefits from crime commission, and decreasing provocations that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the culprit must know the added surveillance for it to achieve its desired impact.</p>
