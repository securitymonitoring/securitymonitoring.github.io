Among IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send out data over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the footage from anywhere. A typical misunderstanding is that wireless means the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still need a power cable. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then connects to the internet and a router. Lastly, wire-free cameras are totally cable television complimentary and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the simplest choice to install and all of the tape-recorded footage is stored in the cloud.</p>
