Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to discover any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge.
