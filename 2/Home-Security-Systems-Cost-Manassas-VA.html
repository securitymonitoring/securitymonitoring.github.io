Lastly, wire-free cameras are totally cable totally free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are essential, these are the easiest alternative to install and all of the tape-recorded footage is saved in the cloud.</p>

<p>I have this camera hooked up to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my corridor.
