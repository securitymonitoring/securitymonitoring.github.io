Instead, you turn signals on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a typical self-monitored system can do like activate a camera to record or trigger the siren.

Regrettably I purchased 4 cameras that look similar to these, believing I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Boy was I incorrect!!
