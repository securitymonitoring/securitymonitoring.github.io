Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge.
