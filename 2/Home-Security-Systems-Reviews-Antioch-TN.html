Outdoor security cameras can discourage bad guys and provide an early warning prior to someone enters your home.

<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be helpful for installation. Since it doesn't have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Unfortunately I acquired 4 cameras that look just like these, thinking I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the exact same camera. Kid was I wrong!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is truly terrific. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
