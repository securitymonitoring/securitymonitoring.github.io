<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to neglect things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires.
