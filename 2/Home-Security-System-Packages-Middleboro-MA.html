Considering that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to manually stop alerts (and recording, because it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity issues, with 2 Hive test systems disconnecting 8 times over 2 months. Scout is really simple to use, especially if you're a fan of mobile devices.
