<p>Indoor cameras are excellent for watching on your pets and kids, but if you're concerned about security, you don't want to risk missing out on a second of the action.

Even though it doesn't have the largest operating temperature variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the few cameras on our list that included a really weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cord quite thick, so you can't really run it through a window opening.</p>
