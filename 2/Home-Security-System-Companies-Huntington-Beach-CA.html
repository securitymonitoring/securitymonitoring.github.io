<p>We have actually all heard that old saying, you get what you pay for". Many wireless home security systems are Do It Yourself and simple to link using 'how-to' videos or the provider's manual. Although you will not have a professional install your security equipment, you'll save cash from installation costs. And when you're all set to move, just evacuate your equipment and re-install it without untangling wires or setting up a service technician. In the London subway bombings in 2005, terrorists carried bombs onto buses and trains, detonating them throughout heavy traffic. After the tragic attacks, cops reviewed CCTV camera video footage and saw the terrorists going into the train station, carrying knapsacks filled with explosives. The terrorists were taped on a number of CCTV cameras, however unfortunately they were neither noticed nor intercepted before they had the ability to perform the attacks.</p>
