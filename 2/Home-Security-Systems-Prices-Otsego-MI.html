<h3>Best Home Security Monitoring in Michigan</h3>
<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our screening-- throughout the day and at night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day. Nest includes the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
<p>The Hive View delivers excellent 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to by hand stop notices (and recording, since it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity issues, with two Hive test units disconnecting eight times over 2 months.
