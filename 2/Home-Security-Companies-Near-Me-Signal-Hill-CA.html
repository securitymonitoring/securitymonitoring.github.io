<p>All individuals with alarm systems securing a property in the City of Fredericksburg need to have a legitimate alarm permit. The combination of digital video surveillance and access control belongs to the natural convergence of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single interface provides extra information that might never ever have been possible previously, such as alert of a worker, by name and recognition number, going into the building. An image of that worker exists on screen for confirmation (validating it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, making sure no tailgating takes place.</p>
