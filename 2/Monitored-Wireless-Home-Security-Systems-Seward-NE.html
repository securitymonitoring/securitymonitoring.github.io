<p>Indoor cameras are excellent for keeping an eye on your animals and kids, but if you're concerned about security, you don't want to run the risk of missing out on a second of the action.

Even though it doesn't have the widest operating temperature variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the couple of cameras on our list that included a truly weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cord rather thick, so you can't truly run it through a window opening.</p>
