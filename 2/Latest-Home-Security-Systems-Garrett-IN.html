(You can safeguard that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension package, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This indicates the Circle 2 ends up being more expensive overall per unit than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't suggest it because its battery-saving routines can disrupt efficiency.</p>
