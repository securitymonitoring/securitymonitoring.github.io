<p>All persons with alarm systems protecting a facility in the City of Fredericksburg should have a legitimate alarm license. The integration of digital video surveillance and gain access to control is part of the natural convergence of security innovations. Centralizing security into a single interface uses extra information that might never ever have actually been possible previously, such as notice of an employee, by name and recognition number, going into the building. An image of that worker exists on screen for verification (confirming it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, guaranteeing no tailgating happens.</p>

<p>Our alarm systems might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge an offense. Once a zone has been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. When the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
