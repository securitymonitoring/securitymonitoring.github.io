<p>The alarm user has thirty (30) days from the date of notification to file an appeal. Appeals must remain in composing and accompanied by supporting documents.

<p>Arlo claims that you should have the ability to get four to 6 months out of a fully charged battery, depending upon settings, use, and surrounding temperature. In long-term screening of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic location. If you're worried about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have actually not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that varied in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it required a full charge once a month.</p>
