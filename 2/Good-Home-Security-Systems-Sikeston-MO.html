<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to neglect items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
