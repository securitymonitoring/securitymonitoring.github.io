<h3>House Security Alarm System Oelwein IA 50662</h3>
<p>A tight wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to disregard objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
