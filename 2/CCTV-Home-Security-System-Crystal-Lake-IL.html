<h3>Alarm System Reviews Crystal Lake IL 60014</h3>
<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to overlook things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
