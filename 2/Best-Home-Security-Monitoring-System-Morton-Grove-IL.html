<p>Indoor cameras are fantastic for watching on your kids and pets, but if you're worried about security, you do not want to risk missing a second of the action. That's why we advise the corded variation of the Logitech Circle 2, which supplies constant recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage for free, with choices for more by means of subscription. Even though it does not have the best operating temperature range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that featured a really weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cord rather thick, so you can't actually run it through a window opening.</p>
