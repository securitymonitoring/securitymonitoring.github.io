<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the whole household will like. It's a neat technique, and one that works quite well, however just as soon as you've set up the remainder of the settings. I've got a huge dog, so needed to specify the areas for the camera to detect i.e. at adult chest height near doors, not low down where the pet will be walking. After a couple of incorrect alerts, and a very startled spouse, I began to rely on the system. Although expect a loud shock if you move it by accident! You can adjust level of sensitivity and likewise select how and when the alarm is activated (by hand, immediately or after an app message), which is sensible.</p>
