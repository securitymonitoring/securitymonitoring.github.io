<p>Despite having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can safeguard that plug and include another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension package, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 ends up being more pricey overall per unit than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof service. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not suggest it given that its battery-saving regimens can disrupt performance.</p>
