<p>DITEK's burglar alarm surge protectors protect your security system against transient rises that can get in through AC power lines, telephone lines and remote alert zones. It's not just about security from theft, either. Adam Kostecki, the senior assistant vice president of digital options and innovation at Amica, suggests sensors that focus on things you wouldn't otherwise see, like leakage sensing units or freeze sensors. Given advantages like that and the more direct capabilities of monitoring and securing your home, it may be the right time to upgrade your security. SimpliSafe equipment covers the essentials. But while ADT systems work with Z-Wave devices, SimpliSafe systems don't. This seriously limits your alternatives for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party smart home devices like lights, locks, thermostats, and outlets.
