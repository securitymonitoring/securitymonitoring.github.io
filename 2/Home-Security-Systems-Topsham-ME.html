Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to disregard objects that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
