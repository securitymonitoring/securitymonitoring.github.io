<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those people and will send smartphone notifies with that information when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
<p>I have this camera attached to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without trouble. The IR lights during the night have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the cost and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
