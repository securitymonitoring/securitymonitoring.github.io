<p>Seattle's main intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more responsible for incorrect alarms, and reduce the number of unnecessary cops and fire actions. Alarm monitoring companies are the professionals and should be teaching their consumers how to effectively set and care for their alarm systems.

Alarm-monitoring companies have delighted in the benefit of cops action to their consumers' alarms without any accountability for the accuracy or reliability of those alarms.</p>
