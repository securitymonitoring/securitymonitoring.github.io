<p>I say sorry to all the Wink fans out there, but to call Wink Lookout a security system is a stretch. Lookout is actually simply an excellent name for a set that includes a Wink wise home center and a few security oriented sensing units. You can't arm and deactivate the system. Instead, you turn informs on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a typical self-monitored system can do like set off a camera to record or trigger the siren.

<p>I have this camera attached to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without trouble. The IR lights at night have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the cost and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests prospective transgressors are less likely to dedicate criminal activity if they think they are being seen or have a higher risk of being apprehended. This is likewise referred to as the reasonable choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime avoidance method, which argues that opportunities to anger can be reduced by altering a range of systems such as increasing the risk of an offender being apprehended, increasing the effort to commit the criminal activity, reducing benefits from criminal offense commission, and lowering provocations that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the transgressor needs to know the included surveillance for it to accomplish its desired effect.</p>
