I called their customer service team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to mention it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the lump sum, due to the fact that apparently they automobile renew you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.

Also I needed to download the user's manual cause one isn't. supplied. The wires are very thin too. The cameras are OKAY for the price I guess.
