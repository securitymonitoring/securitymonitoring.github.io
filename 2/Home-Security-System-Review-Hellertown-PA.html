<p>While every property owner stresses over break-ins, uncertainty has surrounded home security systems due to their typically high costs, complicated agreements with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces often resulting in incorrect alarms. Practically all wireless home security systems utilize a cellular connection; therefore, if your internet goes down or your power heads out, your security system will still work. However, there are still some wireless home security systems that utilize an internet connection as their primary interaction source. Most web linked security systems feature a battery backup, which suggests if the power goes out your alarm will still work for a restricted amount of time. However, if your internet goes down, regrettably, you will be without an alarm system until it comes back up.</p>
