Many systems will consist of many different parts, consisting of sensing units, cameras, temperature detectors, flood finding, smoke identifying, therefore much more.

<p>Our SSA security system was set up at our new home on Friday, June 23rd. Ron Thompson was our sales expert. He provided the recommendations concerning what was needed for our home and was on-site for the installation. Darek arrived and managed the installation right on time. He consulted with us concerning positioning of some of the monitoring gadgets in our home. He also helped me in loading the app and finishing the online set-up process. He also reviewed the new keypad performance. Both Darek and Ron were valuable and really professional. Thanks.</p>

When you include smart cameras to any Blue system, and that rate leaps a lot. We like that you can choose from indoor, outdoor, and doorbell cameras, but every clever camera Blue offers is $200.</p>
