<p>SimpliSafe's mobile and web app controls are also very basic, and do not have nearly the style or polish of a few of its competitors. They get the job done, but they won't win any awards for their eye sweet. And though SimpliSafe does support setting Nest thermostats to away modes when the alarm is set and incorporates with August locks, its wise home integrations aren't nearly as substantial as a few of the other security systems I evaluated.</p>
