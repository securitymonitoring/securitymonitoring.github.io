<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls however will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, normally by means of 110VAC power.</p>
<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and definitely love it. Excellent clarity. I wished to set up seeing on my mobile phone however had a couple concerns that the tech addressed with ease. I Would absolutely buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter alerts, for example. However, those functions come at a relatively steep rate: $5 each month ($50 each year) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 per month ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 each year) for 30 days of video history.  For each additional camera, the subscription is discounted to about half of the initial charge. By comparison, Arlo charges $3 per month for individual detection with 30 days of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those functions and bumps storage as much as 31 days.</p>
