Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to disregard things that exert percentages of pressure on the wires.
