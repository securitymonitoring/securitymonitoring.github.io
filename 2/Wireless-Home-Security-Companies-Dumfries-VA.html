<h3>Best Alarm System For Home in Dumfries VA</h3>

<h3>The Best Home Security in Virginia</h3>
<p>We didn't consider alarm that required expert installation. Pro-installed systems typically cost more, usage equipment similar to that of Do It Yourself systems, featured generally onerous and long contracts, and typically rely on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they offer little advantage. A good example is the Vivint system, which we have actually reviewed individually and don't suggest for many people.</p>
<p>I have this camera linked to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without trouble. The IR lights during the night have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
