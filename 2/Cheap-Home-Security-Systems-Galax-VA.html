<p>Our alarm systems may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize a violation. Once a zone has actually been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. When the signal is received, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>

<p>A taut wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to find any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to ignore objects that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
