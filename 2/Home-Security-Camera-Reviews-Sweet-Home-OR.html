Figure 1-1 depicts an example of a CCTV installation that monitors choose areas of protection. The very first installation was created and established for the separate parking center.

You might even give instructions on how to get into your building. As just recently as ten years back, customers did not have access to technology that let them manage their own home security systems. Smart alarm systems changed that. Originally, traditional security systems were hardwired into the home and monitored by a central station, generally a home alarm company. The consumer paid regular monthly costs.</p>
<p>A lot of security cameras just send you an alert when they spot any kind of activity. Others can identify who-- or what-- is causing the commotion. The Nest Camera IQ provides face-recognition technology, for example. It immediately focuses on individuals who go into the field of vision, and sends alerts when a face is acknowledged (it also informs you when an unacknowledged face is spotted). This technology helps remove needless informs.</p>
