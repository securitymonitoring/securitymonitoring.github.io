<p>Our alarm systems may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge an offense. Once a zone has been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the alarm system's keypad and switching off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
<p>If you hold down the panic or smoke alarm buttons on the burglar alarms touchpad for 1 to 3 seconds, an alarm is transferred to the ADT monitoring center, and emergency situation services are dispatched instantly. An alarm gotten in this manner can not be canceled.
