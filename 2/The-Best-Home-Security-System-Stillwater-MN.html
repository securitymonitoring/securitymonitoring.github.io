<h3>Best At Home Security System in Minnesota</h3>
<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly cost for a set amount of time, usually one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which allow you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-term plan, are ending up being more common. These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that provide a discount in exchange for that prolonged service arrangement. Spending for the equipment up front supplies you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can begin and stop the monitoring service as often times as you desire.</p>
<p>I have this camera attached to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without trouble. The IR lights during the night have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the cost and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
