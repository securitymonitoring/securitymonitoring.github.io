<p>Indoor cameras are terrific for keeping an eye on your animals and kids, but if you're concerned about security, you do not want to risk missing a second of the action. That's why we advise the corded variation of the Logitech Circle 2, which offers constant recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage totally free, with alternatives for more through subscription. Despite the fact that it does not have the widest operating temperature level variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the few cameras on our list that included a truly weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cable quite thick, so you can't truly run it through a window opening.</p>
