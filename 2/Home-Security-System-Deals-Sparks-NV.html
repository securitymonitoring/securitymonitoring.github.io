<p>Our SSA security system was installed at our new home on Friday, June 23rd. Ron Thompson was our sales specialist. He provided the suggestions concerning what was required for our home and was on-site for the installation. Darek dealt with the installation and got here right on time. He consulted with us regarding positioning of a few of the monitoring gadgets in our home. He also helped me in filling the app and finishing the online set-up process. He also evaluated the new keypad performance. Both Darek and Ron were useful and really professional. Thanks.</p>
