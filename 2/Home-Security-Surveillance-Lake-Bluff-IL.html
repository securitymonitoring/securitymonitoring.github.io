As soon as a zone has actually been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. As soon as the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the alarm system's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
