<p>Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a number of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you mean to store and for how long you plan to keep taped video footage. The video footage is going to consume up storage area rapidly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video footage as soon as you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>

<p>We searched for Do It Yourself systems that offered professional monitoring, both with and without an agreement. Although some companies provide heavily discounted or totally free hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to five years, we discovered no-contract systems to be the most flexible. Some people may wish to sign up for service only for when they or their partner runs out town, for instance. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and allow you to be in overall control of the equipment you utilize, as well as how and when you pay and use for monitoring services.</p>
