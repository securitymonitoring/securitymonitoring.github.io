<p>Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer depends upon a number of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you mean to store and how long you plan to keep documented video. The video is going to consume up storage space quickly if there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution.

Note that Frontpoint systems are Z-Wave compatible, so we had the ability to link third-party gadgets for some cool home. automation functions.</p>
