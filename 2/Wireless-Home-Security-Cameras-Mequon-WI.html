<h3>Best Security System Home Mequon WI 53092</h3>
<p>Despite having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and include another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension package, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This indicates the Circle 2 winds up being more pricey overall per unit than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof service. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't advise it given that its battery-saving routines can interrupt performance.</p>
