(You can secure that plug and include another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension package, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 winds up being more pricey general per system than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof service. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it since its battery-saving routines can interrupt efficiency.</p>
