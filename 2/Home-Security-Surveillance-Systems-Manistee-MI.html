However, after nearly 2 years of night, usage and day images have actually always been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing out on motion, an issue we came across when testing the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a creative function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted.
