It has about 25 feet of visibility at night.

<p>Arlo claims that you ought to be able to get four to six months out of a totally charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature. In long-lasting testing of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're worried about charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that varied in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-term screening, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera down to the point where it needed a complete charge once a month.</p>

Outdoor cameras must be weather resistant and in some cases, totally waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance ranking are the most durable. Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor options because their style enables minimum glare.
