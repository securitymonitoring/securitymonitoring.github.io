<p>Get best-in-class security, plus wise home automation the entire family will like. It's a cool trick, and one that works quite well, but only once you have actually set up the rest of the settings. I have actually got a big pet, so required to define the locations for the camera to detect i.e. at adult chest height near doors, not low down where the dog will be walking. After a few false notifies, and a very startled better half, I started to rely on the system. Although expect a loud shock if you move it by accident! You can adjust sensitivity and also pick how and when the alarm is activated (by hand, quickly or after an app message), which is sensible.</p>

<p>I have this camera linked to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights during the night are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the rate and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
