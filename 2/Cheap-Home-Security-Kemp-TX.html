<p>Arlo claims that you must have the ability to get 4 to 6 months out of a completely charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature level. In long-lasting testing of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it needed a complete charge once a month.</p>

We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of as much as 90 seconds between videos.</p>
