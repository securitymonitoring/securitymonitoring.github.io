Xfinity Home Refund Policy for Pre-Payments: If you make a pre-payment prior to installation of your Xfinity Home service, such pre-payment will be used as a credit to charges due on the following month's bill from Comcast. In case you cancel your Xfinity Home service, your pre-payment will be used rather to any other charges due on your costs for Comcast services.
