Smart alarm altered that. Initially, traditional security systems were hardwired into the home and monitored by a main station, usually a home alarm company.

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send smartphone signals with that details when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
