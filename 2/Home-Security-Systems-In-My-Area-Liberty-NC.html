<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and definitely love it. Terrific clarity. I wished to set up seeing on my mobile phone but had a couple questions that the tech addressed with ease. I Would absolutely purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I highly recommend this company.

Nevertheless, those functions come at a comparatively steep cost: $5 per month ($50 annually) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 per month ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 per year) for 30 days of video history.  For each additional camera, the subscription is discounted to about half of the preliminary fee. By comparison, Arlo charges $3 per month for person detection with 30 days of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those functions and bumps storage up to 31 days.</p>
