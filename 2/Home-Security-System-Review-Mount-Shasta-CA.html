<p>All individuals with alarm securing a facility in the City of Fredericksburg must have a valid alarm permit. The combination of digital video surveillance and gain access to control becomes part of the natural merging of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single user interface offers extra information that might never have actually been possible before, such as alert of a staff member, by name and identification number, entering the building. An image of that employee is presented on screen for confirmation (confirming it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, making sure no tailgating happens.</p>

We value that the company continues to iterate and improve a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other choices, it has a limited field of view, and Wyze states it plans to do away with individual detection, at least momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
