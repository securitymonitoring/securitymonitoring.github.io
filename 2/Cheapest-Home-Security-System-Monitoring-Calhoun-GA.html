<h2>Video Surveillance And Security Cameras For Your Home Calhoun</h2>
<p>Recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we concur with its recommendation that users must reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a preventive step. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such events. Nevertheless, after this newest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we do not think that these problems alter the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our current recommendation.</p>
<p>Our SSA security system was set up at our new home on Friday, June 23rd. Ron Thompson was our sales expert. He offered the recommendations regarding what was required for our home and was on-site for the installation. Darek dealt with the installation and got here right on time. He consulted with us concerning positioning of some of the monitoring devices in our home. He likewise assisted me in filling the app and completing the online set-up process. He likewise examined the new keypad functionality. Both Darek and Ron were extremely expert and handy. Thanks.</p>
