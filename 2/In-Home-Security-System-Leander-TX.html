<h3>Security System Monitoring Leander TX 78641</h3>
<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to neglect things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
