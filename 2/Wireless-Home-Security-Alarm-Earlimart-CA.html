<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its restricted, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can protect that plug and add another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension package, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This implies the Circle 2 ends up being more costly total per system than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof solution. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not recommend it because its battery-saving routines can interrupt performance.</p>
