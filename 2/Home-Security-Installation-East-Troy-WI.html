Among IP security alternatives, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send out data over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video from anywhere. A typical misunderstanding is that wireless suggests the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then links to the internet and a router.
