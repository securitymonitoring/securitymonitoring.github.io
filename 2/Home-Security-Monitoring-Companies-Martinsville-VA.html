We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and enhance an item that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other choices, it has a minimal field of view, and Wyze says it prepares to do away with individual detection, at least briefly (more on that in a minute).</p>
