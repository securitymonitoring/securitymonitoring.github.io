<p>Now let's examine why consumer-grade cameras are typically bad night vision performers. When a camera attempts to see in the dark, it needs a source of light to illuminate the location below it.

This indicates they typically over-expose what neighbors in a scene, triggering things and people to appear blown out" and with no information. So much for trying to identify the bad guys. Commercial cameras, however, typically are geared up with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness automatically to the scene. This function is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear effectively exposed and in full detail. If a camera can not capture and deliver a sharp and properly-exposed image throughout the day and at night, it has restricted usefulness.</p>
