<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to ignore items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
