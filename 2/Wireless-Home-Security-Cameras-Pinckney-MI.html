<p>Arlo claims that you must be able to get four to 6 months out of a fully charged battery, depending upon settings, usage, and surrounding temperature. In long-lasting testing of the camera, we usually got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic location. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that varied between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it needed a full charge once a month.</p>
