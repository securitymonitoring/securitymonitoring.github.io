<p>The majority of security cameras can be used both indoors and outdoors. They normally have the same functions like night vision or remote viewing, but they vary in sturdiness. Outdoor cameras need to be weather condition resistant and in some cases, entirely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance score are the most durable. Bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor choices due to the fact that their style allows for minimum glare.
