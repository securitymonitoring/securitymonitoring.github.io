<p>I ask forgiveness to all the Wink fans out there, but to call Wink Lookout a security system is a stretch. Lookout is really simply a fantastic name for a set that includes a Wink clever home center and a couple of security oriented sensing units. You can't arm and deactivate the system. Rather, you turn informs on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a regular self-monitored system can do like set off a camera to record or trigger the siren.
