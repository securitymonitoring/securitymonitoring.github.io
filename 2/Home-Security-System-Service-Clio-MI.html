<h2>Home Security System Options Clio</h2>

Obviously, you may wish to consider purchasing a security camera or more to accompany your system, but going with the five-piece Ring Alarm set plus a Video Doorbell 2 (around $400 total) is a bit more pricey than Frontpoint's the majority of basic package for $320 (or $255 with the 20% advertising deal), which does not include a camera.</p>

In this case the alarm company owns the primary equipment such as control panel, keypad, motion sensor.
