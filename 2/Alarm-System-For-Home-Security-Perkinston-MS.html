<p>The majority of security cameras can be utilized both indoors and outdoors. They usually have the exact same functions like night vision or remote watching, however they differ in sturdiness. Outdoor cameras should be weather condition resistant and in many cases, entirely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance rating are the most resilient. Due to the fact that their design allows for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor choices. In terms of detection, it is better to have a camera geared up with infrared detection instead of motion detection.
