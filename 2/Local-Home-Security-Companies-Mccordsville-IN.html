<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests prospective offenders are less likely to dedicate criminal offense if they believe they are being enjoyed or have a greater danger of being nabbed. This is likewise known as the logical choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime prevention strategy, which argues that opportunities to anger can be minimized by changing a range of systems such as increasing the risk of a culprit being nabbed, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal offense, decreasing rewards from criminal activity commission, and minimizing justifications that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the transgressor needs to understand the added surveillance for it to accomplish its desired impact.</p>
