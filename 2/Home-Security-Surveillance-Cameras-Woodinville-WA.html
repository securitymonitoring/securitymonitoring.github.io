<p>Home security must never ever be limited by where you can put or power your cameras, inside or outdoors. While we constantly motivate central station service, some security system owners do not need or desire a central station involved. Alarm Grid's self monitoring strategies are more economical and allow access to the fantastic functions offered by Overall Link,, or Telguard without being connected to the central station. Additionally, aside from Self Bronze, all of Alarm Grid's self monitoring strategies permit remote access to the robust home automation options provided through a Z-Wave enabled security system. Whether you live in a region where main station service is not readily available or desired, self monitoring (provided world large via web communications) is a cost efficient alternative for keeping you connected and up to date with your professional security system.</p>
