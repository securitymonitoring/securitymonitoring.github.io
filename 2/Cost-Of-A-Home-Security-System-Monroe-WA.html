<p>When we tested the Ring alarm equipment, it worked well. The door sensors are a bit big, which can be troublesome for doors with small or molded frames. (To counteract this problem, Ring's released a slim magnet, which can be bought independently.) And the $199 five-piece kit doesn't have adequate equipment to safeguard most homes entirely. In general, though, whatever did what it was supposed to do. View our reviews and rankings, and search our purchasing guide to find the best security camera for your home.</p>
