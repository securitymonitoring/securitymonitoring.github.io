<p>A taut wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to discover any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to ignore objects that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
