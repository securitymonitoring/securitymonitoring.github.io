<p>A tight wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to neglect things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
