Arlo Pro 2 also has a remarkable Night Vision function. It is equipped with infrared lenses that allow the camera to tape-record videos even in total darkness. It has about 25 feet of presence at night.

<h2>Home Monitoring & Automation Daphne</h2>

<p>Indoor cameras can be part of a complete home security system or used on their own to add additional protection to your home and your loved ones. However home surveillance cameras that stream video and send out informs via email and text can consume a lot of data on your home network. The Requirement and Interactive monitoring strategies can both be bought for any equipment plan and aren't associated with equipment expenses. If you get a system with a camera and choose to have it expertly monitored, though, you'll wish to choose the Interactive strategy.</p>

<p>I have this camera attached to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able place the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights during the night are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the rate and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
