CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a fantastic security camera and an extraordinary worth. It receives an Exceptional rating for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership plans for extra cloud storage.
