<p>Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first concern you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The response hinges on a number of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you plan to keep and how long you plan to keep documented video. The video is going to consume up storage area rapidly if there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution.
