<p>Arlo claims that you must have the ability to get four to six months out of a completely charged battery, depending on settings, usage, and surrounding temperature. In long-lasting screening of the camera, we generally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic location. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have actually not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that changed between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera to the point where it needed a complete charge once a month.</p>
