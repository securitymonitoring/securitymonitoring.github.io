<p>The Douglas County Alarm system Ordinance provides a fair service to a difficult issue: managing our police assets to provide superior law enforcement services. Outdoor security cameras can deter criminals and provide an early caution before someone enters your home. While indoor security cameras typically help people capture a burglar after the fact, you have a much better chance of sending out a burglar running with an outdoor camera. SimpliSafe, on the other hand, tends to cost in between $200 and $500 for preliminary equipment purchase. That's because it doesn't use the rent-to-own model that's popular with the majority of security brands. You're free to resell your SimpliSafe equipment on Amazon or eBay if it does not meet your needs. The client service reps might even suggest reselling as an alternative to giving you a refund.</p>
