<h3>House Burglar Alarm Springfield KY 40069</h3>
<p>A taut wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to neglect things that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
