<h3>CCTV Surveillance Camera in La Puente CA</h3>
<p>I described that all we would need to do is use any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the user interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency button, it sends out double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the threat and, if needed, might simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>

<p>While some elements might be affected for a short while by a power interruption, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electrical energy. Cellular systems utilize cell towers to communicate with the monitoring center in addition to a battery backup that can keep them up and running for a number of hours up until the electrical service is brought back. Landline systems utilize traditional phone lines to communicate with the monitoring center and, similar to cellular systems, they generally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set time period.</p>
