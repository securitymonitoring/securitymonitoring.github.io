<h3>Alarm And Camera Security System Shepherd MI 48883</h3>
<p>A taut wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to neglect objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
