That indicates the camera will wait 5 minutes prior to it's able to record again, which indicates you may be missing a lot. Wyze's recently released Total Motion Capture resolves this problem for $1.50 each month per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately 5 minutes in a row.

<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm, a number of companies offer "totally free monitoring services" for the first few months. Numerous insurer provide discount rates on insurance coverage premiums to customers with operable alarm systems. These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many police departments offer several "complimentary" incorrect alarms before imposing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to react is significant right from the start.
