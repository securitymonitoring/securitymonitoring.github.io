<p>A tight wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to neglect objects that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
