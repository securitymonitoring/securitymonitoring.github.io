<p>C-Mount CCTV cameras are the ideal alternative for those who may want to adjust the field of vision. They are equipped with removable lenses that can be changed around to monitor differing ranges. C-Mount cameras are usually bulky so, like bullet cameras, function as a visible deterrent to criminal activity.

<h3>Wireless Outdoor Security Cameras in Sammamish WA</h3>
<p>This system uses an electro-magnetic field disturbance concept based upon two unshielded (or 'leaking') coax cables buried approximately 30 cm (1 ft) deep and 1 m (10 feet) apart. 6 The transmitter gives off continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable television and the energy is gotten by the other cable. When the modification in field strength compromises due to the presence of an item and reaches a pre-set lower limit, an alarm condition is produced. The system is covert after installation. Care must be taken to make sure the surrounding soil uses good drain in order to prevent annoyance alarms.</p>
