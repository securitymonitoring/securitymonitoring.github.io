Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the extremely idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, covering numerous years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly progressed into the extremely advanced yet economical systems available today.

Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>

<p>The 2nd main distinction is the rates. Wired systems can be infamously expensive. Every aspect of the system will cost you cash. So, at the end, who's robbing who?

<p>I apologize to all the Wink fans out there, but to call Wink Lookout a security system is a stretch. Lookout is actually simply a fantastic name for a package that includes a Wink wise home center and a couple of security oriented sensing units. You can't disarm the system and equip. Instead, you turn alerts on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a normal self-monitored system can do like set off a camera to record or activate the siren.
