<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to neglect objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
