<p>Arlo declares that you need to be able to get 4 to six months out of a fully charged battery, depending on settings, usage, and surrounding temperature. In long-lasting testing of the camera, we typically got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're worried about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have actually not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that fluctuated in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>
