<h3>Alarm Systems For Homes Wireless Altus OK 73521</h3>
<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to neglect things that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
