Although you will not have an expert install your security equipment, you'll save cash from installation expenses. And when you're ready to move, just pack up your equipment and re-install it without untangling wires or arranging a service technician. In the London subway battles in 2005, terrorists carried bombs onto trains and buses, detonating them throughout rush hour. After the terrible attacks, authorities evaluated CCTV camera video and saw the terrorists going into the train station, carrying knapsacks packed with dynamites. The terrorists were recorded on a number of CCTV cameras, but unfortunately they were neither seen nor obstructed before they were able to perform the attacks.</p>
