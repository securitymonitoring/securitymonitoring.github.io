<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security specialists looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a great security camera and a phenomenal worth. It gets an Exceptional score for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid subscription plans for additional cloud storage. But the company does offer a Total Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is detected. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>

<p>Indoor cameras are excellent for keeping an eye on your family pets and kids, but if you're concerned about security, you don't want to run the risk of missing out on a second of the action. That's why we advise the corded variation of the Logitech Circle 2, which offers continuous recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage totally free, with choices for more by means of membership. Even though it doesn't have the widest operating temperature level range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that come with a genuinely weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cord rather thick, so you can't really run it through a window opening.</p>
