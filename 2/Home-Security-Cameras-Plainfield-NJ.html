<h3>Alarm Security Company Plainfield NJ 07060</h3>
<p>A tight wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to overlook items that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
