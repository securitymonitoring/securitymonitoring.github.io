<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. If capturing footage in the dark is a priority, ensure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>

<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a brief description of how thermal cameras work: All objects release infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy produced by a things is referred to as its heat signature. In general, the hotter a things is, the more radiation it discharges. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that is capable of identifying tiny differences in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from items in the scene and develops an electronic image based upon info about the temperature differences. Due to the fact that items are hardly ever exactly the same temperature level as other items around them, a thermal camera can detect them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>
