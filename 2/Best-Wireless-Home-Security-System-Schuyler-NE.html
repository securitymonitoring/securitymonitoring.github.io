<p>Indoor cameras are terrific for keeping an eye on your family pets and kids, but if you're worried about security, you don't want to run the risk of missing out on a second of the action. That's why we advise the corded variation of the Logitech Circle 2, which provides constant recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage totally free, with alternatives for more via subscription. Despite the fact that it does not have the widest operating temperature level range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that included a really weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cable rather thick, so you can't actually run it through a window opening.</p>
