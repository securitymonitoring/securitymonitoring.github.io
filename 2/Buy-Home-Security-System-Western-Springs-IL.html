<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a quick explanation of how thermal cameras work: All objects produce infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy produced by an item is known as its heat signature. In general, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it produces. A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that is capable of identifying tiny distinctions in temperature. The device gathers the infrared radiation from items in the scene and creates an electronic image based upon information about the temperature differences. Because objects are hardly ever exactly the same temperature level as other objects around them, a thermal camera can discover them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>
