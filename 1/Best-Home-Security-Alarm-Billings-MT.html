If you're stressed over charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have actually not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that varied between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent.

This drained the camera to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>
