Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, spanning a number of years. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually evolved into the extremely advanced yet economical systems readily available today. The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and view it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>
