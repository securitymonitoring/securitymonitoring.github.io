We appreciate that the company continues to iterate and enhance an item that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other choices, it has a limited field of vision, and Wyze states it plans to do away with individual detection, at least temporarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
