<h3>Home Automation Security System Euclid OH 44123</h3>
<p>A tight wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to ignore objects that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
