We value that the company continues to repeat and enhance an item that costs about as much as a pizza. Nevertheless, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other choices, it has a limited field of view, and Wyze states it plans to do away with individual detection, at least briefly (more on that in a minute).</p>

Due to the fact that their design allows for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor alternatives.
