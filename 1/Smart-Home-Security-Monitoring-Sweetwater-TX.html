Lookout is actually simply a fantastic name for a kit that includes a Wink smart home hub and a few security oriented sensors. You can't equip and disarm the system. Instead, you turn alerts on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a normal self-monitored system can do like activate a camera to record or activate the siren.
