<p>The Wyze Webcam can likewise record video to the cloud, however the complimentary account is restricted to 12-second clips every 5 minutes. That implies the camera will wait 5 minutes before it's able to tape once again, which implies you may be missing out on a lot. Wyze's just recently released Total Motion Capture fixes this issue for $1.50 per month per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are easy to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the restricted cloud recording and microSD recording, but we don't recommend that for home security due to the fact that if it's stolen, you don't have a backup.</p>
