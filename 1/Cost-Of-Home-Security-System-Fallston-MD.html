<p>Arlo declares that you must have the ability to get 4 to 6 months out of a completely charged battery, depending on settings, usage, and surrounding temperature. In long-lasting testing of the camera, we usually got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that fluctuated in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term testing, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it required a full charge once a month.</p>
