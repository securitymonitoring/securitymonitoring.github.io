<p>A professionally monitored system is viewed by an alarm company from a monitoring center. If there's an issue, the company contacts the property owner and the authorities. If the homeowner verifies there isn't an emergency situation, police aren't called. If the property owner can't be reached, the company accesses the circumstance and can get in touch with the cops if needed. Property owners spend for a security system to be expertly monitored. There's a regular monthly monitoring fee that generally ranges in between $15-40 a month.</p>
