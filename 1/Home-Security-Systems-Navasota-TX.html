When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those people and will send out smartphone informs with that details when they show up at your home.

We also found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV).
