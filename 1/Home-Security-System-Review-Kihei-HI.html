<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly cost for a set quantity of time, generally one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which enable you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-lasting arrangement, are becoming more common. These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that offer a discount in exchange for that lengthy service arrangement. Paying for the equipment in advance provides you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can stop the monitoring and start service as often times as you desire.</p>
<p>A wireless home security system uses a radio frequency to communicate with the control panel and sensing units. The control panel then communicates with a monitoring center using a cellular signal. And, if you have a video camera, the video recordings are sent out to a receiver that's connected to your local or cloud storage. The Nest Web cam Outdoor utilizes a separate mount, instead of an integrated one, so you're not limited to viewing one area. The install is magnetic, however it's strong, so you can quickly connect the camera and move it up, down, and all over in between.</p>
