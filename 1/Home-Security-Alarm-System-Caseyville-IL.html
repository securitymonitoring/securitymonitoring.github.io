If you're stressed over charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have actually not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that fluctuated between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent.

This drained the camera down to the point where it needed a complete charge once a month.</p>
