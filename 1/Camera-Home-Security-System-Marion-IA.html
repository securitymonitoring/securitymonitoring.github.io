<h3>Security Alarm Monitoring in Marion IA</h3>
<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is use any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends dual alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the threat and, if required, could merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
