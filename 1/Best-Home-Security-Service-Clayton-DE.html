<p>A taut wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to ignore items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
