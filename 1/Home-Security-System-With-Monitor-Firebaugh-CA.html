<p>I have this camera hooked up to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without difficulty. The IR lights during the night have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the rate and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
