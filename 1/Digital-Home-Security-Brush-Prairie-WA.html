Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to find any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to ignore objects that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
