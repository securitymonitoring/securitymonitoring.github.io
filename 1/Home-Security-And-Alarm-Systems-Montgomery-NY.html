<p>so say you have a camera that someone can see it they would shoot it if they had a gun so I suggest to have actually cameras integrated in to a house that will be pertected by cameras. Box cameras provide an apparent indication for anyone who goes by that they are being taped on CCTV and this can be a great deterrent of theft and crime. Whereas dome cameras are smaller sized and more discreet. These compact cameras are ideal for monitoring a bigger location such as your front or back garden and can follow movement with ease.</p>
