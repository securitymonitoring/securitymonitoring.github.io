<p>View live status of system and zones, and manage your security system from anywhere using mobile app or computer. You don't require a guard to defend your front door and yard! Alfred will take care of what matters one of the most. Unlike a conventional CCTV camera or IP webcam, you can put Alfred wherever you need to enhance home security. Considering that there are no landline requirements for a wireless security system, this means there are no wires for an intruder to cut or disable, making it a safer option over a wired system.</p>
<p>Frequently a wired system can be confused with local alarms. Nevertheless, the two are dramatically various. The primary difference is that the wired system pairs with the other wise home devices to produce a network of home security around your home. It can be controlled remotely through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile device or through the control board (also known as the alarm panel). A local system does not have the capacity to couple with other smart gadgets and can not be controlled from another location. Likewise a local alarm will not call the authorities; it simply triggers an audible siren to notify people nearby.</p>
