Although battery replacements are required, these are the easiest choice to install and all of the taped video is kept in the cloud.</p>

<p>Indoor cameras are terrific for keeping an eye on your kids and animals, but if you're concerned about security, you don't want to risk missing a second of the action. That's why we suggest the corded version of the Logitech Circle 2, which offers continuous recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage for free, with alternatives for more through subscription. Despite the fact that it doesn't have the best operating temperature level variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that included a truly weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cord quite thick, so you can't actually run it through a window opening.</p>
