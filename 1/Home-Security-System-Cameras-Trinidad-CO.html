<p>While every property owner frets about burglaries, suspicion has actually surrounded home security systems due to their typically high costs, complex contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces frequently resulting in incorrect alarms. Almost all wireless home security systems use a cellular connection; therefore, if your internet goes down or your power goes out, your security system will still work. However, there are still some wireless home security systems that use a web connection as their primary communication source. The majority of internet connected security systems feature a battery backup, which suggests if the power heads out your alarm will still work for a restricted amount of time. However, if your internet goes down, unfortunately, you will lack an alarm system till it comes back up.</p>

<p>Smart device integration: If you have a home loaded with smart devices, think about looking for a security camera or an all-in-one home monitor that consists of a Z-Wave, ZigBee, or-- eventually a Thread-- radio that can link them. Support for an automation service such as IFTTT or Stringify is also useful. This allows the camera or monitor to respond to different circumstances, such as taking an image when your Nest Protect discovers smoke, or informing your Philips Hue smart bulb to switch on when unexpected sounds are detected.</p>

Some systems also offer a direct, one-touch connection to local police.</p>
