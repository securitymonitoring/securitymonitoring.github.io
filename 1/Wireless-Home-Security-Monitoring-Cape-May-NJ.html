Nevertheless, there are still some wireless home security systems that use an internet connection as their primary communication source.

<p>Indoor cameras are fantastic for keeping an eye on your family pets and kids, but if you're concerned about security, you don't want to risk missing a second of the action. That's why we suggest the corded variation of the Logitech Circle 2, which provides constant recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage for free, with alternatives for more through subscription. Despite the fact that it doesn't have the best operating temperature level variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the few cameras on our list that come with a truly weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cord quite thick, so you can't truly run it through a window opening.</p>
