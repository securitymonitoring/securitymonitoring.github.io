<p>Arlo claims that you need to have the ability to get four to six months out of a completely charged battery, depending upon settings, usage, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term screening of the camera, we usually got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have actually not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that varied between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term testing, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it needed a complete charge once a month.</p>
