<p>I have this camera hooked up to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without problem. The IR lights in the evening are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the rate and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
