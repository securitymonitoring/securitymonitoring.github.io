Xfinity Home Refund Policy for Pre-Payments: If you make a pre-payment prior to installation of your Xfinity Home service, such pre-payment will be applied as a credit to charges due on the following month's costs from Comcast. In the event you cancel your Xfinity Home service, your pre-payment will be used rather to any other charges due on your bill for Comcast services. You will not receive a money or charge card refund of your pre-payment. However, if all of your services from Comcast are disconnected, or if Comcast is otherwise required under appropriate law to refund the pre-payment, Comcast will, within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise specified by suitable law, return a sum equivalent to the pre-payments your made (without interest unless otherwise needed by law) minus any amounts due on your account (consisting of, without restriction, any quantities owed for any services or for any equipment that is damaged, modified or not returned).</p>

<h3>House Safety Alarm System in Hurst TX</h3>
<p>The Abode Smart Security Package, our previous runner-up, is still a solid choice for some individuals. Home has upgraded that version with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which offers a much better variety for sensing units. Both the initial Residence system and the Home Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only design we evaluated that likewise works with HomeKit. We've encountered a couple of technical issues while long-term testing the Abode Iota, therefore will continue to test and upgrade accordingly. We no longer suggest it.</p>
