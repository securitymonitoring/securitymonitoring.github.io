Outdoor security cameras can discourage criminals and provide an early warning prior to someone enters your home. While indoor security cameras typically help individuals catch a burglar after the reality, you have a better chance of sending out a thief running with an outdoor camera.

<p>Arlo claims that you must be able to get 4 to six months out of a completely charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature. In long-lasting testing of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic location. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have actually not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that fluctuated in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term testing, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it needed a full charge once a month.</p>
