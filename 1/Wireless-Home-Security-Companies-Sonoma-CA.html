<h3>Security System Reviews in Sonoma CA</h3>
<p>The Home Smart Security Set, our previous runner-up, is still a solid option for some individuals. Residence has upgraded that variation with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which offers a much better range for sensors. Both the original House system and the Abode Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only design we evaluated that also deals with HomeKit. We've encountered a couple of technical problems while long-term testing the House Iota, and so will continue to evaluate and upgrade accordingly. We no longer suggest it.</p>
