Several other designs were disqualified due to efficiency issues. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, frequently buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of as much as 90 seconds between videos.</p>
<p>Due to the minimal level of control (in comparison to onsite security management), it's important to establish a in-depth and clear  security structure.
