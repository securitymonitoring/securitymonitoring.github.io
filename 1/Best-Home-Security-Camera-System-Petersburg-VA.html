<p>so say you have a camera that somebody can see it they would shoot it if they had a weapon so I suggest to have actually cameras built in to a house that will be pertected by cameras. Box cameras present an obvious indication for anybody who goes by that they are being taped on CCTV and this can be a great deterrent of theft and crime. Whereas dome cameras are smaller and more discreet. These compact cameras are perfect for monitoring a larger location such as your front or back garden and can follow movement with ease.</p>

Luckily, their systems are Do It Yourself; we had our sensing units and cameras installed in about 25 minutes (not great, but not horrible). The home intrusion functions were on-point, but we want to see more smart-home choices offered out-of-the-box.
