<h3>Digital Security Systems Middletown PA 17057</h3>
<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm system, a variety of companies use "complimentary monitoring services" for the very first few months. Lots of insurance companies provide discounts on insurance premiums to customers with operable alarm systems. These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many cops departments use several "totally free" incorrect alarms prior to imposing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to react is substantial right from the start. The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance providers cast doubt on the appropriateness of the existing trend in U.S. policing of enabling three or four complimentary false alarms per fiscal year, since they supply no up-front rewards to motivate owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
