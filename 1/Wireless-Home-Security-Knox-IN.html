<p>GO2 provides full-service Video Surveillance Installation of high definition (HD), IP, digital, outdoor, and wireless Security Camera Systems. Normally, most occupants select a Do It Yourself wireless installation due to the fact that their property manager won't enable holes to be drilled in the walls and ceilings. And because many property owners do not want a third-party contractor tapping into the existing wiring which might produce a liability for them should a fire take place. Arlo states that the system utilizes three layers of encryption, with limited Web access on the Base Station and no local access on the camera or the Base Station. Also, in the interest of continuously enhancing security, the company has actually been dealing with hacker crowdsourcing company Bugcrowd to operate a personal Bug Bounty program, which is open to the general public too.</p>
