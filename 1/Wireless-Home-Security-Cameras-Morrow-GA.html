Bullet cameras are round and long in shape and are ideal for outdoor use. Their strengths lie specifically in applications which require cross country viewing. Set up within protective casings, the cameras are protected versus dust, dirt and other natural elements.

<p>I have this camera linked to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without problem. The IR lights during the night are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the rate and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<h3>Domestic Security Systems Morrow GA 30260</h3>
<p>The majority of security cameras can be utilized both indoors and outdoors. They generally have the same functions like night vision or remote viewing, but they vary in resilience. Outdoor cameras need to be weather resistant and in some cases, entirely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance score are the most resilient. Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor options because their design allows for minimum glare. In regards to detection, it is better to have a camera geared up with infrared detection rather than motion detection. Because typically times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will provide more accurate and less regular signals.</p>
