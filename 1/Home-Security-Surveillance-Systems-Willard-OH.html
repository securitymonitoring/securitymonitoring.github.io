<p>A wireless doorbell camera can work as a stand-alone gadget or in tandem with the rest of your security system. When somebody calls the doorbell, it triggers the doorbell camera. That video can go to your smart device, computer system, or to a screen inside your home. Doorbell cameras belong to many home automated systems and supply an extra layer of protection. These cameras often come with two-way talk, night vision, and an integrated motion sensing unit. Just like any security camera, take a look at the video resolution and field of view.
