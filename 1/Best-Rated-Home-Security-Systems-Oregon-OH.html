<p>We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for one of our top areas.

The Area can record approximately 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, however entries were often missing, despite appearing in the app's activity timeline. With basic wise home gadgets like automatic door locks, you can stay in bed and inspect that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you keep an eye out for potential package thieves or speak with visitors who visit.</p>
