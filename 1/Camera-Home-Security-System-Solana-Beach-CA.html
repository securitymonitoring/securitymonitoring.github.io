<h3>Home Wireless Alarm Solana Beach CA 92075</h3>
<p>A taut wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to disregard objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
