You can add a Z-Wave or Zigbee smart lock to the system without much effort if you're utilizing a home automation center to control things like lighting and thermostats. Alternately, if you do not have a home automation hub, search for a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that comes with its own mobile app. Smart locks use standard pre-drilled holes and are relatively easy to install. Some designs use your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and connect to the inside of your door, while others require that you eliminate your existing exterior and interior escutcheons and change the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
