<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a terrific security camera and a phenomenal value. It gets an Excellent ranking for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep video footage locally on an SD card.

You press a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's taking place on the other end. And while this is a pretty standard feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is relatively unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>
