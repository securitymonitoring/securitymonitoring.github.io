With night vision zoom, infrared LEDs, and infrared lens technology, Zosi Wireless Security Camera System records crystal clear video day or night-an essential element of a home security system.

<p>SimpliSafe's mobile and web app controls are also really basic, and do not have nearly the style or polish of some of its competitors. They get the job done, however they won't win any awards for their eye sweet. And though SimpliSafe does support setting Nest thermostats to away modes when the alarm is set and incorporates with August locks, its wise home integrations aren't almost as extensive as a few of the other security systems I checked.</p>
