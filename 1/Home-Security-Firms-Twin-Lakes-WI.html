<p>I have this camera hooked up to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without difficulty. The IR lights at night have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
