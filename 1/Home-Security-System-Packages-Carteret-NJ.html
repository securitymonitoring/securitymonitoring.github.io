Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning several years. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets.

Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
