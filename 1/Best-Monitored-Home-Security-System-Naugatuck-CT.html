Throughout screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera down to the point where it needed a complete charge once a month.</p>
