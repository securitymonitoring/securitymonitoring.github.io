A private with a camcorder, or the paparazzi, might have a more self-satisfying agenda and thanks to digital innovation and the Internet can break privacy laws with far more terrible repercussions than video surveillance cameras, which are kept secured and in rigorous confidence.</p>

These facilities are characteristically well-equipped with top-of-the-range protective steps - guided by rigid federal privacy standards and security mandates.</p>
