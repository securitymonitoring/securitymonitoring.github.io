If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, without any gaps in between. Recordings are easy to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the restricted cloud recording and microSD recording, however we do not suggest that for home security since if it's taken, you do not have a backup.</p>
