<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you desire to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the agreement.. So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I was in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Truly annoying. Once again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to mention it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the swelling amount, because obviously they auto renew you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.  ADT is a problem, method too costly, and not great.</p>

When a patient pushes the emergency button, it sends out double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the threat and, if needed, could simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>
