Now, a lot of security systems include a multitude of elements, such as a base station, security camera, motion, entry, and glass break sensors, a keypad, and essential fobs, to name a few elements.

Requirement parts in most home security packages consist of a master control panel, the control keypad, sensor pads for windows and doors and a motion sensing unit device.
