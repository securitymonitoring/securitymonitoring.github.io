<p>Indoor cameras are great for keeping an eye on your family pets and kids, but if you're worried about security, you do not want to risk missing a second of the action. That's why we suggest the corded version of the Logitech Circle 2, which offers constant recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage totally free, with alternatives for more by means of membership. Even though it does not have the largest operating temperature variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the few cameras on our list that included a really weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cord quite thick, so you can't really run it through a window opening.</p>
