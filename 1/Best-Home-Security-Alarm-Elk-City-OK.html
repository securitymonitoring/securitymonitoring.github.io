<p>We provide value-added security and surveillance systems and services providing benefit, peace of mind and fulfillment to every client and are devoted to satisfying our consumer's needs with integrity, honesty, enthusiasm and outstanding service. Among IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send information over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and permits that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A common mistaken belief is that wireless suggests the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then connects to a router and the web. Lastly, wire-free cameras are totally cable totally free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the easiest option to install and all of the recorded video is kept in the cloud.</p>

<p>The Wyze Cam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security option (although we enjoyed it as a pet camera ). It has since been improved and now rivals our top choices due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and a number of smart-home integration options. We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and improve an item that costs about as much as a pizza. Nevertheless, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other picks, it has a restricted field of view, and Wyze says it plans to do away with individual detection, at least temporarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
