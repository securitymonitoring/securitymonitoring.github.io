<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services offering convenience, peace of mind and satisfaction to every customer and are devoted to satisfying our customer's requirements with stability, sincerity, interest and outstanding service. Amongst IP security alternatives, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send data over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video from anywhere. A typical misunderstanding is that wireless means the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still require a power cord. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then connects to the internet and a router. Lastly, wire-free cameras are completely cable free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the most convenient option to install and all of the recorded video is saved in the cloud.</p>

<p>I described that all we would require to do is use any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also included two-way audio, and that camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency button, it sends double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if needed, could simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
