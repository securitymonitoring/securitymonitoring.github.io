<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. If recording footage in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
