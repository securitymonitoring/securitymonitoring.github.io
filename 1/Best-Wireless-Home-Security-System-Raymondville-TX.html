<p>While every house owner worries about break-ins, skepticism has actually surrounded home security systems due to their typically high costs, complex contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces typically leading to false alarms. Almost all wireless home security systems use a cellular connection; for that reason, if your internet goes down or your power goes out, your security system will still work. Nevertheless, there are still some wireless home security systems that utilize a web connection as their primary interaction source. The majority of internet linked security systems come with a battery backup, which indicates if the power goes out your alarm will still work for a restricted amount of time. But, if your web goes down, sadly, you will be without an alarm till it comes back up.</p>

During our hands-on screening of Brinks, we discovered the systems to be rather easy to establish and use-- but not quite as easy as brands like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm.</p>
