They utilize infrared night vision, have adjustable settings, and live stream to the Frontpoint app. To get the most out of the camera, place it where it's most visible. Its wireless installation offers you a great deal of versatility. If the camera is battery powered you can place it basically anywhere without any wires, charging the battery and eliminating when it runs low, which is normally prompted through its app. Clearly the advantage is that these can be put anywhere extremely quickly, but the drawback is that if it's easy for you to get rid of the camera to change the battery, it'll probably be easy for trespassers to eliminate it too.</p>
