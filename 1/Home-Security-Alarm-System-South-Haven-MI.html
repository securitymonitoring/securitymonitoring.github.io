The typical factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing an opportunity for the destructive opponent to tape-record these codes and utilize numerous splitting tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can launch a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based upon the "design" security crucial recorded during the network recovery.</p>
