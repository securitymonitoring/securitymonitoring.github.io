<p>In spite of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug.

Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we don't suggest it because its battery-saving routines can interrupt efficiency.</p>
