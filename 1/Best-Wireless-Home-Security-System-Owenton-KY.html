Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, covering several years.

The innovation gradually progressed into the extremely advanced yet affordable systems offered today.

Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>

<p>The Wyze Camera v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security choice (although we loved it as an animal camera ). It has because been improved and now matches our top choices due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and numerous smart-home integration choices. We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and improve a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other picks, it has a minimal field of view, and Wyze says it plans to do away with individual detection, a minimum of briefly (more on that in a minute).</p>
