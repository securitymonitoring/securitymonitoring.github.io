<p>A taut wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to ignore objects that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
