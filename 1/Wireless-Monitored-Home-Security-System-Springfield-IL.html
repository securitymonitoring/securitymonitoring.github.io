Its dual articulating LED floodlights cover a really large area, and you can dim them by means of its app if you want mood lighting on your deck or outdoor patio for a celebration. In addition they can not transfer fluid video, just still frame images or low resolution bits of video.

Initially check the suppliers return policy and second keep the invoice if you do buy them.</p>
