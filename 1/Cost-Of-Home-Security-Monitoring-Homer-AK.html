<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and absolutely enjoy it. Excellent clarity. I wanted to establish seeing on my cellular phone but had a couple questions that the tech addressed with ease. I Would certainly buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what offers the video history and smarter informs, for instance. Nevertheless, those features come at a relatively steep price: $5 each month ($50 annually) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 per month ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 each year) for thirty days of video history.

<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Call for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small fee.

If the wireless security system is not on a contract basis, all of these costs will be paid in advance. Some clients report investing $500 up to $2,000 to start their wireless security system.</p>
