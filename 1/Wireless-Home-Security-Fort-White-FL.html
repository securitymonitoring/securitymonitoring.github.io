If the system was not set up throughout the homebuilding process, setting one up might require drilling holes into walls, running new wires, patching drywall and getting to difficult spots that are sealed in attics or basements. Wired security systems are also susceptible to power interruptions. Most will have a backup battery system that turns on in case of an outage, but long term interruptions will lead to the system losing power.
