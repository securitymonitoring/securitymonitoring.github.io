Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to overlook items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
