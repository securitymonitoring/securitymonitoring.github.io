<p>Arlo claims that you must be able to get four to 6 months out of a completely charged battery, depending upon settings, usage, and surrounding temperature level. In long-lasting testing of the camera, we usually got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that varied in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting screening, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it required a full charge once a month.</p>
