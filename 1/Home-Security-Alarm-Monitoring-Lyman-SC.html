Yes, property owners can pick to self-monitor" their home security system.

<p>We searched for DIY systems that used expert monitoring, both with and without an agreement. Although some companies supply heavily discounted or free hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to five years, we found no-contract systems to be the most flexible.

No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and permit you to be in overall control of the equipment you use, in addition to how and when you utilize and pay for monitoring services.</p>
