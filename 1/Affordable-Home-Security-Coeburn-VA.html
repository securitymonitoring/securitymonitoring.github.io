<p>Arlo declares that you need to have the ability to get 4 to six months out of a totally charged battery, depending on settings, usage, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term testing of the camera, we generally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're worried about charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that varied in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it needed a full charge once a month.</p>
