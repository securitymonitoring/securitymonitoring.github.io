<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our testing-- throughout the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based upon available bandwidth, which might change throughout the day. Nest consists of the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
