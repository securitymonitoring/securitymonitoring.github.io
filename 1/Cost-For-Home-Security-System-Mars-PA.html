<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a short explanation of how thermal cameras work: All items produce infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy given off by an object is referred to as its heat signature. In general, the hotter a things is, the more radiation it discharges. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that can discovering small distinctions in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and develops an electronic image based on information about the temperature distinctions.
