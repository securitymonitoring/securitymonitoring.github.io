I called their customer support team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the swelling sum, due to the fact that apparently they auto renew you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.  ADT is a headache, way too pricey, and not excellent.</p>
