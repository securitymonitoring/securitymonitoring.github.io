<p>We have actually all heard that old stating, you get what you spend for". Wish to add a flood sensing unit? A clever door lock? Your system can function as a center for up to 119 clever home devices, and can be managed via Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple TELEVISION, and more. IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends out data from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, need a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a different power source, implying a more complex setup and more wires. PoE switches are also typically considered a more secure method to transmit information.</p>
