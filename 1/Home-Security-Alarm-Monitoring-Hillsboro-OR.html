<p>A taut wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to overlook items that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
