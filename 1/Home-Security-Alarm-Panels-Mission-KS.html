<p>Everything about Security supplies professional, trustworthy alarm monitoring services for homes and companies throughout the greater Indianapolis area. Figure 1-1 portrays an example of a CCTV installation that keeps an eye on select locations of protection. The first installation was developed and established for the different parking center. This implementation consisted of a number of set position cameras on each floor of the parking lot, stairwells, and exits, all linked straight to a main control unit (PCU) for management of each video stream. The PCU is a simple device for managing the input and output of video feeds through the coax cable televisions. Secondary utilities and devices can provide basic integration of some alarms, but this innovation has actually restricted abilities and a complex combination process.</p>
