<h3>Cost For Home Security System in Illinois</h3>
<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: If you want the best of whatever, you'll desire Vivint. And if you're paying for a Vivint security system, it makes sense to get the smart home tech. Spring for the midlevel strategy and get the automated door lock and wise thermostat for the price of equipment and $10 additional a month. If you can't afford the extra equipment, we still like Vivint's basic plan. It includes mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay additional for).</p>

Some systems likewise provide a direct, one-touch connection to local police.</p>
