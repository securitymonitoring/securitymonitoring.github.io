We also discovered the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>

Through an accompanying Annke Vision app, you can see live streams and view playbacks quickly on a mobile phone on the go.
