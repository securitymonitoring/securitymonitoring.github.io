Despite the fact that it doesn't have the widest operating temperature level variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the few cameras on our list that featured a genuinely weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cord rather thick, so you can't truly run it through a window opening.</p>
