<p>Vivint offers a month-to-month contract, but you'll need to acquire all of your equipment upfront to open that choice. Like many home security companies, Vivint's equipment can be costly, and paying a minimum of $600 at the time of purchase might not fit into your budget.

<p>But monitored systems likewise tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month charge for a set quantity of time, usually one to five years. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of committing to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more common. These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that provide a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service contract. Spending for the equipment up front provides you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can stop the monitoring and begin service as often times as you desire.</p>
