I Would absolutely buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter notifies, for instance. However, those functions come at a relatively high rate: $5 each month ($50 per year) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 each month ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 annually) for 1 month of video history.
