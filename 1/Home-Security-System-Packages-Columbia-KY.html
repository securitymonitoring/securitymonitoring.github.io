<p>Indoor cameras are great for keeping an eye on your family pets and kids, however if you're concerned about security, you don't wish to run the risk of missing a second of the action. That's why we suggest the corded variation of the Logitech Circle 2, which supplies continuous recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage totally free, with alternatives for more via subscription. Despite the fact that it does not have the largest operating temperature range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that included a genuinely weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cord rather thick, so you can't truly run it through a window opening.</p>
