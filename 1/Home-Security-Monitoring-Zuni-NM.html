<p>The Wyze Web cam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security option (although we enjoyed it as a pet camera ).

We value that the company continues to repeat and enhance an item that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other choices, it has a restricted field of vision, and Wyze says it plans to do away with individual detection, a minimum of momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
