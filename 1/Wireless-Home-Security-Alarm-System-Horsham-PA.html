Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to ignore items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
