The answer hinges on a number of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you intend to save and how long you prepare to keep documented footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to consume storage area quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest footage once you reach the system's capability, but if you're not mindful, the system might overwrite archived video that you still need.</p>
