<p>I described that all we would require to do is use any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends out double informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the danger and, if needed, might just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
