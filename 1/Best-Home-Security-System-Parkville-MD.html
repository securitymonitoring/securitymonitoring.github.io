<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you desire to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the contract..

Again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to discuss it, it's on you to read the small print.
