<p>The Hive View provides terrific 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too easily, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting.

<p>Indoor cameras are terrific for watching on your animals and kids, but if you're worried about security, you don't wish to run the risk of missing out on a second of the action. That's why we recommend the corded variation of the Logitech Circle 2, which provides constant recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage totally free, with alternatives for more through subscription. Even though it doesn't have the widest operating temperature range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the few cameras on our list that included a truly weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cord quite thick, so you can't really run it through a window opening.</p>
