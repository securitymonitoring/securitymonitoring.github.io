Xfinity Home Refund Policy for Pre-Payments: If you make a pre-payment prior to installation of your Xfinity Home service, such pre-payment will be used as a credit to charges due on the following month's expense from Comcast. In the event you cancel your Xfinity Home service, your pre-payment will be used rather to any other charges due on your expense for Comcast services. You will not receive a money or credit card refund of your pre-payment. However, if all of your services from Comcast are disconnected, or if Comcast is otherwise required under suitable law to refund the pre-payment, Comcast will, within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise defined by relevant law, return an amount equal to the pre-payments your made (without interest unless otherwise required by law) minus any amounts due on your account (consisting of, without restriction, any quantities owed for any services or for any equipment that is damaged, altered or not returned).</p>

When purchasing a video recorder, you must initially make certain that the device will work with the cameras you've bought. If you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system, the cameras need to be able to provide you with the essential info.</p>

<h3>Home Camera System Auburn MA 01501</h3>
<p>Despite having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can safeguard that plug and include another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension kit, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This suggests the Circle 2 winds up being more expensive general per unit than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't advise it because its battery-saving routines can interrupt efficiency.</p>
