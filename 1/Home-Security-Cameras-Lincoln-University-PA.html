That means the camera will wait 5 minutes before it has the ability to tape again, which indicates you may be missing out on a lot. Wyze's just recently released Complete Motion Capture fixes this issue for $1.50 monthly per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately five minutes in a row.

Recordings are easy to discover under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, but we don't recommend that for home security due to the fact that if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>
