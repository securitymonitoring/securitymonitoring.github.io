We understand how pricey changing proprietary innovation can be. That's why we only sell equipment that all alarm companies can monitor so that you can recycle the exact same system indefinitely.

<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our testing-- during the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should note that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based on available bandwidth, which could change throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
