<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, however not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the need for more electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, normally via 110VAC power.</p>
