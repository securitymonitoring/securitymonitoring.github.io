Amongst IP security alternatives, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send data over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and permits that user to see the video from anywhere. A typical misunderstanding is that wireless means the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still need a power cable. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then links to a router and the internet. Lastly, wire-free cameras are completely cable free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the most convenient choice to install and all of the recorded footage is stored in the cloud.</p>

<p>We like that the Argus 2 features a color night vision option, but the white and black version can actually be clearer and offer you higher-quality video. This isn't actually a big deal considering the Argus 2's price and all its other features-- however for the record, stick to black and white. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo wise service. However the coolest feature is that you can charge it with the assistance of solar power with a solar panel charger.</p>
