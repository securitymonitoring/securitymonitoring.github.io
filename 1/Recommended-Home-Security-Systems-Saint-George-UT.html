That means the camera will wait 5 minutes before it has the ability to tape again, which implies you may be missing a lot. Wyze's recently introduced Complete Motion Capture solves this problem for $1.50 per month per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, without any spaces in between. Recordings are simple to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, but we don't recommend that for home security because if it's taken, you do not have a backup.</p>
