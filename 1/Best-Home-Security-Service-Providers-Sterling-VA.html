The usual reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing a chance for the malicious attacker to tape these codes and utilize different cracking tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system.
