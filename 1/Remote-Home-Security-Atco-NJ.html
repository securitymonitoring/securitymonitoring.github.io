<p>All of the systems we've checked feature an app that lets you use your smartphone as your command center to arm and disarm the system, create rules, include and delete parts, and get push notices when alarms are triggered. Most apps also enable you to do things like view live and recorded unlock, video and lock doors, modification thermostat settings, and silence alarms. Some apps will even utilize your phone's place services to automatically equip and disarm the system according to your physical location. The more pricey systems generally include a wall-mounted panel that serves as a communications hub, with a touch-screen screen that allows you to do whatever the app does. The display lets you communicate with an expert monitoring service when an alarm is activated and view video from any of the installed security cameras.</p>
<p>A wireless home security system uses a radio frequency to communicate with the control board and sensing units. The control panel then communicates with a monitoring center utilizing a cellular signal. And, if you have a camera, the video recordings are sent to a receiver that's connected to your local or cloud storage. The Nest Webcam Outdoor uses a different mount, instead of an incorporated one, so you're not limited to viewing one area. The install is magnetic, however it's strong, so you can easily connect the camera and move it up, down, and everywhere in between.</p>
