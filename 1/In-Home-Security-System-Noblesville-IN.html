<p>A taut wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to discover any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to overlook things that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
