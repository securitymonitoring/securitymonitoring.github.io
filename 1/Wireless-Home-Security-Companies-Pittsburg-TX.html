In long-lasting testing of the camera, we typically got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have actually not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term screening, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera to the point where it needed a complete charge once a month.</p>
