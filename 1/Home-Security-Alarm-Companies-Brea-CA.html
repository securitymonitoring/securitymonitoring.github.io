<p>Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a number of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you plan to store and the length of time you prepare to keep taped video footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to consume storage area rapidly.

<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests potential wrongdoers are less most likely to devote criminal offense if they believe they are being viewed or have a greater threat of being captured. This is also referred to as the reasonable option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance technique, which argues that chances to offend can be lowered by modifying a range of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a wrongdoer being apprehended, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, reducing rewards from criminal activity commission, and decreasing provocations that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the wrongdoer needs to know the included surveillance for it to attain its wanted impact.</p>
