<p>Any outdoor camera worth its salt need to have the ability to withstand direct exposure to the components and ought to bring an IP (Ingress Protection) rating IP ratings consist of two digits that tell you simply how well the camera will hold up under most climate condition. The first digit following the IP prefix informs you how resistant the camera is to the ingress of solid things such as wind-blown dust and varies from 0 (no protection) to 6 (overall protection against dust and dirt).

<p>Having animals means you will need to consider their size, motions, and any other elements that might trigger issues. For example, if you have family pets that are over 30 pounds, you will require a security system whose motion sensors can be adjusted or a system that can be set up in such a way that your large family pets won't trigger incorrect alarms to be sent whenever your animal moves. If you have big family pets, you might wish to consider avoiding the motion sensing units and rely more on the doors and window sensors which aren't triggered by movement but are set off when a window or door is opened.</p>

Even though it doesn't have the best operating temperature range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that included a really weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cable rather thick, so you can't truly run it through a window opening.</p>
