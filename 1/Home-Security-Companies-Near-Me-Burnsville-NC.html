<p>so say you have a camera that somebody can see it they would shoot it if they had a gun so I suggest to have actually cameras integrated in to a house that will be pertected by cameras. Box cameras present an obvious indication for anyone who passes by that they are being taped on CCTV and this can be an excellent deterrent of theft and criminal activity.
