<p>Frontpoint's outdoor cameras are the most budget friendly in terms of both equipment cost and monthly monitoring charges. They utilize infrared night vision, have adjustable settings, and live stream to the Frontpoint app. To get the most out of the camera, place it where it's most visible. Its wireless installation gives you a great deal of flexibility. If the camera is battery powered you can position it basically anywhere with no wires, recharging the battery and removing when it runs low, which is generally triggered through its app. Clearly the advantage is that these can be placed anywhere really quickly, but the drawback is that if it's easy for you to eliminate the camera to alter the battery, it'll most likely be simple for burglars to remove it too.</p>

Overall, though, whatever did what it was supposed to do. View our rankings and reviews, and search our buying guide to discover the best security camera for your home.</p>
