<p>DITEK's alarm system rise protectors safeguard your security system versus transient surges that can enter through Air Conditioner power lines, telephone lines and remote alert zones. It's not practically security from theft, either. Adam Kostecki, the senior assistant vice president of digital solutions and innovation at Amica, advises sensing units that focus on things you would not otherwise notice, like leakage sensors or freeze sensing units. Given benefits like that and the more direct capabilities of monitoring and protecting your home, it may be the right time to update your security. SimpliSafe equipment covers the essentials. However while ADT systems deal with Z-Wave gadgets, SimpliSafe systems do not. This seriously restricts your choices for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party clever home devices like lights, locks, thermostats, and outlets. If you currently have a security device from another brand, like a Blink XT camera, it probably won't deal with your SimpliSafe system.</p>
