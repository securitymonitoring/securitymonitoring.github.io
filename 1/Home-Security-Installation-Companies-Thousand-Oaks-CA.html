<h2>Ganz Security Solutions, Video Surveillance Security Thousand Oaks</h2>
<p>In a current New York Times short article about Chicago's 911 expanding digital video surveillance system, Albert Alschuler, a law teacher at Northwestern University, makes the point that public camera systems do not break any personal privacy concerns since they are set up in public areas. They have been implemented for public safety and criminal activity avoidance and are not for the exploitation of individuals. A private with a camcorder, or the paparazzi, might have a more self-satisfying program and thanks to digital technology and the Web can break personal privacy laws with much more devastating consequences than video surveillance cameras, which are kept protected and in strict self-confidence.</p>
<p>Many video surveillance cameras, in any classification, provide audio capabilities. This function can be one-way, where, in addition to the video imagery, the device uses accompanying audio surveillance. It can likewise be two-way audio, which supplies not only the ability to monitor the video and audio but also a method of providing audio instructions through the camera or its accessory speaker. Audio also adds another layer of required compatibility with the choose VMS software application, so make sure the audio as well as the video is supported (and that audio recording is legal).</p>

<h3>Best House Alarm System Thousand Oaks CA 91360</h3>
<p>A tight wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to overlook objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
