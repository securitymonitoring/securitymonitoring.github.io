<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends prospective culprits are less likely to dedicate criminal offense if they think they are being watched or have a higher threat of being captured. This is also known as the reasonable choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance technique, which argues that chances to upset can be minimized by altering a range of systems such as increasing the threat of a wrongdoer being apprehended, increasing the effort to commit the criminal offense, reducing benefits from criminal activity commission, and decreasing justifications that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the culprit should be aware of the included surveillance for it to achieve its desired impact.</p>
