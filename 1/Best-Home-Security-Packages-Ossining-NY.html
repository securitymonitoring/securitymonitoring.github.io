<p>We tried to find Do It Yourself systems that used professional monitoring, both with and without a contract.

Some individuals might wish to register for service only for when they or their partner is out of town, for instance. No-contract systems likewise cost less in the long run and allow you to be in overall control of the equipment you use, along with how and when you pay and use for monitoring services.</p>
