<p>Like any product that connects to the web and uses wireless technology, clever home security systems are vulnerable to hacking, particularly systems that do not have file encryption. Hackers can sit outside your home and utilize a laptop computer and software application to obstruct wireless signals originating from your system that permit them to reduce alarms and disable sensing units. Other gadgets enable hackers to generate radio noise that can jam communications between the sensing units and the center.</p>
