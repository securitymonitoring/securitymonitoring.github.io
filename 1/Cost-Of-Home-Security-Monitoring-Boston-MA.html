<h2>Advanced Video Surveillance Security Solutions Boston</h2>
<p>We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top spots. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape-record approximately 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were often missing, in spite of showing up in the app's activity timeline. With standard smart home gadgets like automatic door locks, you can stay in bed and examine that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you keep an eye out for prospective package burglars or speak with visitors who visit.</p>

That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty busy with nifty smart home functions. We specifically liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>
