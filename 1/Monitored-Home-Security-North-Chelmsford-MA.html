<p>Arlo declares that you need to be able to get four to six months out of a completely charged battery, depending upon settings, use, and surrounding temperature. In long-term screening of the camera, we typically got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have actually not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that fluctuated in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting screening, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera to the point where it needed a complete charge once a month.</p>
