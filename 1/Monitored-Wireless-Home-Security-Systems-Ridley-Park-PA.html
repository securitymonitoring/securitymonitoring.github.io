Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to find any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to ignore objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
