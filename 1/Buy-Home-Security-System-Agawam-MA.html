Many apps also allow you to do things like view live and recorded lock, video and unlock doors, change thermostat settings, and silence alarms. Some apps will even use your phone's area services to automatically disarm the system and equip according to your physical location. The more expensive systems usually come with a wall-mounted panel that functions as a communications hub, with a touch-screen display that allows you to do whatever the app does. The display screen lets you interact with a professional monitoring service when an alarm is triggered and view video from any of the set up security cameras.</p>
