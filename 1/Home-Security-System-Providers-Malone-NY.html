<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security specialists investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a fantastic security camera and an incredible worth. It gets an Exceptional score for video quality and is simpler to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep video in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid subscription prepare for extra cloud storage.

<p>The Wyze Camera v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be an effective security alternative (although we loved it as a pet web cam ). It has actually because been improved and now equals our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and a number of smart-home integration options. We appreciate that the company continues to iterate and enhance an item that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other choices, it has a limited field of view, and Wyze states it plans to do away with individual detection, a minimum of momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
