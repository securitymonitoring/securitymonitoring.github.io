<p>Security cameras are a staple for any security system. When you're away, they permit you to record video and keep an eye on your home. Numerous security packages or stand-alone cameras enable you to control and access your home cameras no matter where you are.

Some security companies supply their app totally free, however others only supply the app with higher-priced security packages.</p>
<p>The Wyze Cam can also catch video to the cloud, however the complimentary account is limited to 12-second clips every 5 minutes.

Wyze's recently introduced Total Motion Capture fixes this problem for $1.50 each month per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly starts another, without any gaps in between. Recordings are simple to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, however we do not suggest that for home security since if it's taken, you do not have a backup.</p>
