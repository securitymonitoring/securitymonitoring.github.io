<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. SimpliSafe responded with a declaration saying the system would inform users when it found any kind of disturbance. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be a best storm of circumstances for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to replicate the concern. Although our screening shouldn't be taken as definitive, we believe this concern is not likely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe customers who own the current system.</p>
