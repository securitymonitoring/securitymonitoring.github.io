<h3>Smart Home Security System in California</h3>
<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can determine people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send mobile phone signals with that information when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
