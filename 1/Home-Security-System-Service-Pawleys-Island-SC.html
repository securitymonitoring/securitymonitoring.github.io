<h3>Top Home Security Companies in South Carolina</h3>
<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: If you want the best of whatever, you'll desire Vivint. And if you're paying for a Vivint security system, it makes sense to get the smart home tech. Spring for the midlevel plan and get the automatic door lock and smart thermostat for the price of equipment and $10 extra a month. We still like Vivint's basic bundle if you can't afford the extra equipment. It includes mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay extra for).</p>
<p>Efficient in running in both regular and poorly lit environments, these cameras benefit from not requiring inbuilt infrared illuminators as they can catch clear video images in the dark thanks to their extra sensitive imaging chips. For this factor, these cameras are perfect for outdoor surveillance applications in which IR cameras are not able to operate optimally. Not only does Ring (now owned by Amazon) make video doorbells, it makes security cameras too: here we're picked the wireless, battery powered model, however there is a wired version also if you don't wish to stress over ever having to charge the batteries.</p>
