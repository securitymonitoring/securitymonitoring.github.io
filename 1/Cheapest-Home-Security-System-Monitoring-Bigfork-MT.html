<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: If you want the best of everything, you'll want Vivint. And if you're paying for a Vivint security system, it makes sense to get the wise home tech. Spring for the midlevel plan and get the automated door lock and wise thermostat for the price of equipment and $10 additional a month.

<p>Having family pets means you will need to consider their size, movements, and any other factors that could cause problems. For example, if you have pets that are over 30 pounds, you will require a security system whose motion sensors can be changed or a system that can be installed in such a way that your big family pets will not trigger incorrect alarms to be sent out every time your family pet relocations. If you have big animals, you might wish to think about avoiding the motion sensors and rely more on the doors and window sensors which aren't set off by movement but are activated when a window or door is opened.</p>
