<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a quick explanation of how thermal cameras work: All objects discharge infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy emitted by an object is called its heat signature. In general, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it produces. A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of spotting tiny distinctions in temperature. The device collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and produces an electronic image based upon information about the temperature level differences. Because items are hardly ever exactly the same temperature as other things around them, a thermal camera can find them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>
