AHD cameras use the exact same RG59 or RG6 cable as standard CCTV cameras. CAT-5 cable television with video baluns can also be utilized. While pro monitoring costs more, it's more secure. When something activates your alarm, your monitoring company will get the alert and then alert the authorities for you. Appears like a much safer bet to us.</p>

A RADIUS server can also be configured to enforce user policies and constraints along with record accounting info such as connection time for purposes such as billing.</p>
