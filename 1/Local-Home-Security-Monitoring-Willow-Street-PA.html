<p>Indoor cameras are excellent for keeping an eye on your kids and family pets, but if you're concerned about security, you don't wish to risk missing a second of the action. That's why we recommend the corded version of the Logitech Circle 2, which offers continuous recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage for free, with choices for more through subscription. Although it does not have the best operating temperature range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the few cameras on our list that included a really weatherproof cord and plug.
