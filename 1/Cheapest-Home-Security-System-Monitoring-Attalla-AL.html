<h3>Wireless Security System Companies in Attalla AL</h3>
<p>There's a lot to like about the Maximus Camera Floodlight, beginning with its camera's crisp, clear 1080p video. Its dual articulating LED floodlights cover a very large area, and you can dim them by means of its app if you want mood lighting on your deck or outdoor patio for a celebration. Furthermore they can not transmit fluid video, only still frame images or low resolution snippets of video.

<h3>The Best Security System For Your Home Attalla AL 35954</h3>
<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests possible culprits are less most likely to commit criminal offense if they think they are being watched or have a greater danger of being captured. This is also known as the logical choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance strategy, which argues that chances to anger can be reduced by modifying a range of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a transgressor being captured, increasing the effort to dedicate the crime, decreasing rewards from criminal offense commission, and reducing provocations that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the offender should be aware of the added surveillance for it to accomplish its preferred impact.</p>
