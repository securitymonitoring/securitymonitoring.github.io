<h3>DVR Security Camera System Escondido CA 92027</h3>
<p>A taut wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to neglect objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
