<p>A tight wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to neglect things that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
