<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: If you desire the best of everything, you'll want Vivint. And if you're spending for a Vivint security system, it makes good sense to get the wise home tech. Spring for the midlevel strategy and get the automated door lock and smart thermostat for the cost of equipment and $10 additional a month. If you can't pay for the extra equipment, we still like Vivint's basic package. It includes mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay extra for).</p>
<p>Video surveillance systems and devices prevent theft and vandalism and record offenders. Dome and hidden cameras install out of sight to record suspicious activity and protect home. Devices such as wall brackets and camera housings can help to support and protect closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems from outdoor components. Interact with your alarm from anywhere by looking at live video, or answering your front door while you're at work. When you are away, smarter security options keep you in control.</p>

This means you will get emergency situation service, you will pay less, it is easier to call the company, and you will be promoting the local economy.</p>
