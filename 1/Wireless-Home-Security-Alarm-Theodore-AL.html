<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Put simply, wireless security systems count on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work using radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensors, lights and other security equipment are all linked to one base station or panel to get sensing units needed to control your equipment consisting of allowing, disabling and sending you instant alerts. As soon as a signal is received, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, text, e-mail, or web portal.

<p>Simply bought a bullet ip system and definitely enjoy it. Great clearness. I wanted to set up viewing on my mobile phone however had a couple concerns that the tech answered with ease. I Would absolutely buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I highly suggest this company.

However, those features come at a comparatively steep rate: $5 monthly ($50 per year) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 per year) for 30 days of video history.
