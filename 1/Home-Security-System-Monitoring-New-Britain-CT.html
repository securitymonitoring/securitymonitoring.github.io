I Would definitely buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely recommend this company.

However, those functions come at a relatively steep price: $5 monthly ($50 per year) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 each month ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 per year) for 1 month of video history.
