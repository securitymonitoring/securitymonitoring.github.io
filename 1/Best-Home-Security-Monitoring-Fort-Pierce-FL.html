<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can work with every camera. Of course, DVRs require analog cameras, while NVRs utilize IP cameras, however the compatibility question extends well beyond that difference. Some NVR systems, for instance, work with the IP cameras just from specific makers and not others. When buying a video recorder, you must initially make sure that the device will work with the cameras you have actually purchased. The cameras must be able to supply you with the required information if you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system.</p>

<p>This system utilizes an electro-magnetic field disruption concept based on two unshielded (or 'leaky') coaxial cables buried approximately 30 cm (1 ft) deep and 1 m (10 ft) apart. 6 The transmitter produces constant Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is received by the other cable television. When the modification in field strength damages due to the existence of an item and reaches a pre-set lower threshold, an alarm condition is generated. The system is concealed after installation.

<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm, a variety of companies provide "totally free monitoring services" for the first couple of months. Many insurance provider use discount rates on insurance premiums to customers with operable alarm. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous authorities departments provide a number of "complimentary" incorrect alarms before enforcing any fine, even though the cost to respond is significant right from the start. The deals of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers bring into question the suitability of the present pattern in U.S. policing of allowing three or four totally free false alarms per calendar year, since they provide no up-front rewards to encourage owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
