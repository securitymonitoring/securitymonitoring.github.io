<p>All individuals with alarm systems securing a facility in the City of Fredericksburg must have a legitimate alarm license. The combination of digital video surveillance and access control is part of the natural convergence of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single interface uses additional information that might never ever have been possible before, such as alert of an employee, by name and recognition number, entering the structure. A picture of that worker exists on screen for verification (confirming it's not a taken ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, ensuring no tailgating takes place.</p>

<h3>CCTV Home Security in Oregon</h3>
<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send out mobile phone alerts with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
