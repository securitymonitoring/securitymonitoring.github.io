<h3>Business Security Alarms Little Ferry NJ 07643</h3>
<p>A taut wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to neglect things that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
