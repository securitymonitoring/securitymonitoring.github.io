<p>For all its adaptability, we want the Circle 2 included a local storage choice. As it is, you'll need to sign up for a cloud strategy to get more than 24 hr of video history.

IP cameras are far more effective than analog cameras, typically shooting video of between 1 megapixel and 5 megapixels. That produces extremely clear image quality, particularly compared to the more grainy analog video footage, which runs around one-half of a megapixel. IP cameras generally have a bigger visual field than analog cameras.</p>
<p>When portability and mobility are necessary to property owners, wireless systems have a guaranteed advantage, since they can be removed easily and re-installed quickly. With no drilling or detailed electrical circuitry to be done, wireless systems usually don't need expert installation, and given that they do not need a substantial and labor-intensive  elimination of wires, they can be moved relatively easily, a certain benefit for occupants and individuals on the go. It's a versatile form of security technology, because sensing units can be moved and added with relative ease. They are also highly integratable, since wireless systems can be synched up with other home automation features, such as wise locks and lights.</p>
