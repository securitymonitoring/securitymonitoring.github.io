<h3>Video Surveillance System Sapulpa OK 74066</h3>
<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its restricted, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension package, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This indicates the Circle 2 winds up being more pricey overall per unit than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not recommend it given that its battery-saving routines can disrupt efficiency.</p>
