<p>Indoor cameras are terrific for keeping an eye on your family pets and kids, however if you're concerned about security, you do not want to risk missing out on a second of the action. That's why we suggest the corded variation of the Logitech Circle 2, which offers continuous recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage totally free, with alternatives for more via subscription. Even though it doesn't have the largest operating temperature range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that included a truly weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cable quite thick, so you can't truly run it through a window opening.</p>
