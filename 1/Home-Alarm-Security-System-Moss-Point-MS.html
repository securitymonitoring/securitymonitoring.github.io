When a zone has actually been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. As soon as the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>

The Nest Camera Outdoor utilizes a separate mount, rather than an integrated one, so you're not restricted to viewing one area.
