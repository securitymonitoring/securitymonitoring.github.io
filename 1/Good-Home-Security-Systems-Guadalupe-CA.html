For the most detailed protection of your home, you want something that includes night vision and can tape-record at a decent quality - and practically all cameras now come with a minimum of HD (1080p) resolution. Some, like our present top security camera recommendation the Arlo Ultra, go up from that to provide 4K resolution.</p>
