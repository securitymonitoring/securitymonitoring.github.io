<h3>Home Alarm System Monitoring in Hayesville NC</h3>

<h3>Home Security Installation in North Carolina</h3>
<p>first of all the package seemed to have been opened when it arrived. so then I open the cameras and whatever seemed OKAY up until I began to install the cameras outside of my home and discovered one one the cameras do not work and they don't come in color. Also I had to download the instruction manual cause one isn't. provided. The wires are very thin too. The cameras are OK for the rate I guess. A great deal of the Nest Cam IQ Outdoor (and any other Nest Camera's) best features lag a paywall of sorts.</p>
<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be helpful for installation. It also makes your camera more tamper-proof due to the fact that it does not have wires that can be cut. Sadly I bought 4 cameras that look just like these, thinking I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Young boy was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of the box. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is truly fantastic. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
