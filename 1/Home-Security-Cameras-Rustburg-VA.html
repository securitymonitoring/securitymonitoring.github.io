<p>But monitored systems likewise tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly fee for a set quantity of time, usually one to five years. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-term arrangement, are ending up being more typical. These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that provide a discount in exchange for that lengthy service agreement. Spending for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can begin and stop the monitoring service as often times as you desire.</p>
