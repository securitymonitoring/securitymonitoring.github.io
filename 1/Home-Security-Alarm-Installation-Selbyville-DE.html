<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls however will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, generally via 110VAC power.</p>
