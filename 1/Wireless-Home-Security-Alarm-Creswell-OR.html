<h3>Security Alarm System Companies Creswell OR 97426</h3>
<p>A taut wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to ignore objects that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
