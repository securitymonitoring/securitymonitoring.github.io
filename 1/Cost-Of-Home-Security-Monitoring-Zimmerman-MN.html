<h3>Cheapest Home Security System Monitoring in Minnesota</h3>
<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. When it detected any type of disturbance, SimpliSafe responded with a statement stating the system would notify users. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be a best storm of circumstances for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to duplicate the concern. Although our screening should not be taken as definitive, our company believe this concern is unlikely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe clients who own the existing system.</p>
