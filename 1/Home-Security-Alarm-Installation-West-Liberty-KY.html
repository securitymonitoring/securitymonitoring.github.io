<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
