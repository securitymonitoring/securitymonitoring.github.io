<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a brief explanation of how thermal cameras work: All things give off infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy given off by an object is referred to as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it discharges. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that can identifying small distinctions in temperature. The gadget gathers the infrared radiation from things in the scene and develops an electronic image based on information about the temperature differences. Since things are rarely specifically the very same temperature level as other items around them, a thermal camera can discover them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>
