<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Ring for a well-priced DIY system that you can self-monitor or get expertly monitored for a small charge.

The upfront cost of wireless security systems can be pricey. Factor in the in advance cost of the control board, activation charges, monitoring fees and all equipment. All of these expenses will be paid upfront if the wireless security system is not on an agreement basis. Some customers report investing $500 approximately $2,000 to start their wireless security system.</p>
