<p>As the name recommends, this alarm is a starter set". So it's basically expected that it will not have actually extended customizability or a wide range of features.

<p>A compelling argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe subscription is that it adds person detection, which makes for smarter smartphone alerts-- and, in many cases, fewer false alerts. You will not have to fret about it taping or sending an alert every time the dog strolls by if the camera is pointed toward a high-traffic area. (We think this is a better feature if you're placing the Circle 2 outside, where vehicles regularly pass.) Although having the membership makes this camera smarter, it's excellent that it's not necessary, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Webcam.</p>
