Our tester selected the Interactive strategy however ended up disappointed with its lack of live video surveillance. When she got an alarm notice while on getaway, she had no chance of gauging whether her home had been broken into or if her cat had actually managed to journey the sensing unit. It turned out to be a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
