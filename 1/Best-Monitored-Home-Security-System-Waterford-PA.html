<h3>Wireless Security Camera System Waterford PA 16441</h3>
<p>A taut wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to overlook items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
