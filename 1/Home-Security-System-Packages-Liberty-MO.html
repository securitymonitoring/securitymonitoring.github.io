<p>We didn't consider alarm systems that required professional installation. Pro-installed systems typically cost more, usage equipment comparable to that of Do It Yourself systems, included generally onerous and long contracts, and typically count on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they provide little benefit. A fine example is the Vivint system, which we have actually reviewed individually and don't recommend for many people.</p>
<p>GO2 offers a wide range of outdoor security cameras that are completely designed to offer reliable surveillance coverage for your business or home. Vivint's smart security equipment caters well to Seattle's dog-lovers, short-term leasing owners, and techies. Smart keypad locks, smart thermostats, and the Vivint App make everything from letting in a dog walker to renting out your home safer and easier.
