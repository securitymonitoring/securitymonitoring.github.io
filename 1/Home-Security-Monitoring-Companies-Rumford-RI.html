<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a malicious attacker, because the disruption of the network prevents the flow of data and actually indirectly secures information by avoiding it from being transmitted. The usual reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying a chance for the malicious opponent to tape-record these codes and use various splitting tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can launch a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based on the "model" security essential captured during the network healing.</p>
<p>Audio and video verification methods utilize microphones and cameras to record audio frequencies, video signals, or image pictures.

<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to ignore items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
