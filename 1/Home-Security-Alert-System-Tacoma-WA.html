CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is a great security camera and a sensational value. It receives an Exceptional ranking for video quality and is simpler to use than the other cameras on this list. It likewise succeeds in our privacy and security tests.

Wyze's recently launched Complete Motion Capture resolves this issue for $1.50 monthly per camera.

If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly begins another, with no spaces in between.
