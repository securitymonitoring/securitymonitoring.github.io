<p>We love that the Argus 2 features a color night vision alternative, but the white and black variation can really be clearer and offer you higher-quality video footage. This isn't really a huge offer thinking about the Argus 2's price and all its other functions-- however for the record, stick with white and black.

<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly fee for a set amount of time, generally one to five years. No-contract systems, which allow you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of devoting to a long-lasting plan, are becoming more common. These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that offer a discount in exchange for that lengthy service contract. Paying for the equipment up front supplies you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can start and stop the monitoring service as sometimes as you want.</p>
<p>We looked for Do It Yourself systems that provided professional monitoring, both with and without an agreement. Although some companies provide heavily reduced or complimentary hardware in exchange for a service dedication that can last anywhere from one to 5 years, we discovered no-contract systems to be the most flexible. Some people may want to sign up for service only for when they or their partner is out of town, for instance. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and enable you to be in overall control of the equipment you utilize, along with how and when you pay and utilize for monitoring services.</p>
