Among IP security alternatives, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send out data over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the footage from anywhere. A typical misunderstanding is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then links to a router and the web. Lastly, wire-free cameras are entirely cable free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are needed, these are the simplest choice to install and all of the recorded video is saved in the cloud.</p>
