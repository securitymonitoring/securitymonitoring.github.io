When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those individuals and will send mobile phone alerts with that information when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION).
