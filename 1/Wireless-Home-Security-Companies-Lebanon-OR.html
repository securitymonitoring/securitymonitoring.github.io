Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge.
