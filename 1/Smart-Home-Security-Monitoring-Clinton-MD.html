<p>Arlo claims that you ought to have the ability to get four to six months out of a completely charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term screening of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic location. If you're worried about charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting screening, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera to the point where it needed a full charge once a month.</p>
