When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send out smart device signals with that info when they appear at your home.

We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
