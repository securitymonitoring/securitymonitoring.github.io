For example, you can have a smart plug turn on a lamp indoors or trigger an external siren when the camera identifies motion.</p>
<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can deal with every camera.

When purchasing a video recorder, you should first ensure that the device will deal with the cameras you have actually purchased. If you're dealing with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system, the cameras must have the ability to provide you with the essential details.</p>
