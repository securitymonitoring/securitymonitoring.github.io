Handle your home no matter where you are with the Vivint Smart Home app. Utilize your mobile phone to speak and see with visitors at your door, see and safeguard packages, track activity with kept video clips, or engage with household in your home.

<p>Some home insurance service providers require you to have an alarm system as part of their policy. However, alarms needed by insurance provider should comply with the European Standard EN 50131 and must be installed by an NSI or SSAIB certified installer. All of the smart alarms on the marketplace presently do not abide by the European Standard, and as they're created to be self-installed, they won't be accepted by your insurance company. By integrating LiveWatch DIY security systems with Moni's expert monitoring, we can see Brinks Home Security taking on other big names in the industry. Throughout our hands-on testing of Brinks, we found the systems to be rather easy to establish and use-- however not rather as simple as brand names like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm.</p>
