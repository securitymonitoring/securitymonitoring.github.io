<h3>Security Cameras For Your Home in Saluda SC</h3>
<p>Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The response hinges on a couple of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you intend to store and how long you plan to keep recorded video. The video footage is going to eat up storage space quickly if there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest footage when you reach the system's capability, but if you're not mindful, the system may overwrite archived video that you still need.</p>

If you have an analog security camera system, then the digital video recorder (DVR) that the security cameras are connected to has a hard disk inside of it.
