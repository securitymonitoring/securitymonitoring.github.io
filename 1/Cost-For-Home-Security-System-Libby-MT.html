<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is a fantastic security camera and a phenomenal value. It receives an Excellent rating for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It likewise does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid membership plans for extra cloud storage. However the company does offer a Total Motion Capture service that continually records for as long as motion is spotted. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
