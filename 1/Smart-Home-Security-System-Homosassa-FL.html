CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance method, which argues that chances to offend can be reduced by changing a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a culprit being apprehended, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, reducing rewards from criminal offense commission, and decreasing justifications that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This means that the offender must know the included surveillance for it to attain its wanted effect.</p>
