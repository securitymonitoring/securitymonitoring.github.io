<p>We provide value-added security and surveillance systems and services using convenience, comfort and fulfillment to every customer and are committed to satisfying our consumer's needs with stability, honesty, interest and exceptional service. Among IP security choices, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send information over a wireless network.

This is not the case as wireless cameras might still need a power cord. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then links to the web and a router. Finally, wire-free cameras are completely cable complimentary and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the simplest option to install and all of the taped video is kept in the cloud.</p>
