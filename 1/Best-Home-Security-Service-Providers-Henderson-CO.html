<p>I have this camera hooked up to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without difficulty. The IR lights at night have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the cost and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
