No-contract systems, which permit you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than dedicating to a long-lasting arrangement, are becoming more typical. These systems often cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that use a discount rate in exchange for that lengthy service contract.

Despite the fact that it does not have the largest operating temperature variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the few cameras on our list that included a really weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cable rather thick, so you can't actually run it through a window opening.</p>
