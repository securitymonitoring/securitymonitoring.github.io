In long-term screening of the camera, we usually got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have actually not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that changed between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent.

This drained pipes the camera to the point where it needed a complete charge once a month.</p>
