<h3>Security Alarm System For Home Saint Augustine FL 32084</h3>
<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to ignore items that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
