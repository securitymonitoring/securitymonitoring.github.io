Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical effort to penetrate the barrier.

Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to neglect objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
